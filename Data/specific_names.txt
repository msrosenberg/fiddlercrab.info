acuta	acuta;acuto;acutus	acuta	Gelasimus acutus	Stimpson1858	Named after the extremely acute angles of the carapace at the tip of the antero-lateral margins.	.
affinis	affinis	tetragonon	Gelasimus affinis	GuerinMeneville1829.1	.	<em class="species">Gelasimus affinis</em> was originally used by Guérin-Méneville for a species which he later realized was already described as <em class="species">Uca tetragonon</em> (Herbst, 1790), making <em class="species">affinis</em> a junion synonym.</p><p>The name was later independently used by Streets (1872) to describe a species from the Caribbean. Since the name was preoccupied by Guérin-Méneville's original use, it was unavailable to Streets, and this second species is now known as <em class="species">Uca burgersi</em> Holthuis, 1967.
africana	africana	?	Uca africana	White1847.1	Named after Africa, where the specimen was found.	A <em>nomen nodum.</em> The name only appears in a published list from a museum collection with no description; specimen can no longer be found, so identity cannot be determined. Nomenclatural usage from that time would imply the name was most likely applied to a specimen which would now be part of the genus <em class="species">Ucides.</em>
albimana	albimana;albimaba;albimanus	albimana	Gelasimus annulipes var. albimana	Kossmann1877	Latin for &ldquo;white-handed.&rdquo;	.
amazonensis	amazonensis	chlorophthalmus	Uca amazonensis	Doflein1899	Named after the Amazon, where the specimens were supposedly collected, although evidence suggests a labeling error since the species is actually only found in the western part of the Pacific Ocean and the Indian Ocean and not not in the Americas.	<em class="species">Uca amazonensis</em> Doflein, 1899, is a junior synonym of <em class="species">Uca chlorophthalmus</em> (H. Milne Edwards, 1837).
angustifrons	angustifrons	bellator	Gelasimus signatus var. angustifrons	deMan1891	Latin for &ldquo;narrow-brow&rdquo; or &ldquo;narrow-forehead&rdquo;	<em class="species">Gelasimus signatus var. angustifrons</em> De Man, 1891, is a junior synonym of <em class="species">Uca bellator</em> (Adams &amp; White, 1848)

argillicola	argillicola	argillicola	Uca argillicola	Crane1941	Named for the white clay where the species was found.	.
armatus	armatus	insignis	Gelasimus armatus	Smith1870.2	Latin for &ldquo;armored.&rdquo;	<em class="species">Gelasimus armatus</em> Smith, 1870, is a junior synonym of <em class="species">Uca insignis</em> (H. Milne Edwards, 1852)
atlanticus	atlanticus	tangeri	Gelasimus atlanticus	Baudouin1906	Named for the Atlantic Ocean.	Baudouin (1906) suggested that the name <em class="species">tangeri</em> was too narrow because it implied the species was only found in a limited location, and that perhaps a more general name such as <em class="species">atlanticus</em> would be better. One can argue whether this is a formal proposal for a name or not, but Monod (1956) specifically treated it as a proposed name, thus <em class="species">Gelasimus atlanticus</em> Baudouin, 1906, is a junior synonym of <em class="species">Uca tangeri</em> (Eydoux, 1835).
australiae	australiae	demani	Uca (Deltuca) demani australia	Crane1975	Named for its southern distribution (Latin noun &ldquo;auster&rdquo; = the south)	The status of this species is highly questionable. It is only known from a single, poor-quality specimen found washed up on the shore of Australia. It is generally believed to not be valid.
barbimana	barbimana	>Utica barbimana	Uca barbimana	Schafer1954	.	This name appears in a list of species, but is more than likely an error/typo in the genus by the author and should refer to <em class="species">Utica barbimana.</em>
basipes	basipes	?	Gelasimus basipes	.	.	An unpublished manuscript name, known only from a bottle in the Paris museum containing a mix of narrow-fronted species. Mentioned in Crane (1975).

boninensis	boninensis	boninensis	Uca boninensis	Shih2013.2	Named after the Bonin Islands (the old name for the Ogasawara Islands). Bonin is derived from the Japanese munin meaning &ldquo;a place without residence.&rdquo;	.
borealis	borealis	borealis	Uca (Thalassuca) vocans borealis	Crane1975	Named for its northern distribution, after the Greek noun <em>Boreas</em> for &ldquo;northern wind.&rdquo;	.
brasiliensis	brasiliensis	rapax	Uca pugnax brasiliensis	Oliveira1939.1	Named after Brazil.	<em class="species">Uca pugnax brasiliensis</em> Oliveira, 1939, is a junior synonym of <em class="species">Uca rapax</em> (Smith, 1870).

consobrinus	consobrinus	annulipes	Uca consobrinus	Verwey1930	.	<em class="species">Uca consobrinus</em> was first used in print by Verwey (1930) but he got the name from an unpublished museum label of De Man. <em class="species">Uca consobrinus</em> Verwey, 1930, is a junion synonym for <em class="species">Uca annulipes</em> (H. Milne Edwards, 1837).
cordata	cordata;cordatus	>Ucides cordatus	Cancer Cordatus	Linnaeus1763	Latin for &ldquo;heart-shaped.&rdquo;	This species is not a fiddler crab.
cordiformis	cordiformis	>Heloecius cordiformis	Gelasimus cordiformis	MilneEdwards1837.2	Seems to be Latin for &ldquo;heart-shaped.&rdquo;	This species is not a fiddler crab.

demani	demani	demani	Uca demani	Ortmann1897	Named after the Dutch biologist, Johannes Govertus de Man.	.
desjardinii	desjardinii	tetragonon	Gelasimus desjardinii	GuerinMeneville_nd	Likely named after the French zoologist Julien François Desjardins.	This name, which derives from a museum label, only appears in print (Kingsley, 1880) as a synonym of <em class="species">Uca tetragonon</em> (Herbst, 1790)
dexialis	dexialis	?	Gelasimus dexialis	.	.	An unpublished manuscript name from Latreille, known from a dried, broken and unidentifiable specimen in the Paris museum. Mentioned in Crane (1975).

dussumieri	dussumieri	dussumieri	Gelasimus Dussumieri	MilneEdwards1852	Named after the French merchant Jean-Jacques Dussumier, who collected many zoological specimens while traveling.	.
ecuadoriensis	ecuadoriensis;ecuatoriensis	ecuadoriensis	Uca ecuadoriensis	Maccagno1928	Named after the country of Ecuador.	.
eibli	eibli	festae	Uca (Minuca) leptochela eibli	Bott1958	Named after the collector, Dr. I. Eibl-Eibesfeldt	<em class="species">Uca (Minuca) leptochela eibli</em> Bott, 1958, is a junior synonym of <em class="species">Uca festae</em> Nobili, 1901
elegans	elegans	elegans	Uca elegans	George1982	Named in reference to the long and elegant fingers of the major and minor chelae (from the Latin for &ldquo;graceful&rdquo;)	.
excellens	excellens	insignis	Gelasimus (Acanthoplax) excellens	Gerstaecker1856	.	<em class="species">Gelasimus (Acanthoplax) excellens</em> Gerstacker, 1856, is a junior synonym of <em class="species">Uca insignis</em> (H. Milne Edwards, 1852). This synonymy was identified by Rathbun, but she mixed some specimens of <em class="species">Uca ornata</em> and <em class="species">Uca insignis</em> together. The type of <em class="species">excellens</em> does not appear to be extant, but if it was found and turned out to be a synonym for <em class="species">Uca ornata</em> Smith, 1870, it would have priority.
excisa	excisa	excisa	Uca Marionis var. excisa	Nobili1906.3	From the Latin word meaning &ldquo;cut out&rdquo; (as in "excised")?	Nobili (1906) proposed <em>excisa</em> as a substitute for Dana's (1851) use of the name <em class="species">nitida,</em> since the latter was already a homonym of an earlier usage by Desmarest (1817). Crane considered Nobili's rather loose proposal to have no taxonomic standing. Her interpretation was incorrect, and Nobili's name currently has priority for this species. 
festae	festae	festae	Uca Festae	Nobili1901.3	Named after Italian naturalist Enrico Festa.	.
flammula	flammula	flammula	Uca (Deltuca) [coarctata] coarctata flammula	Crane1975	From the Latin noun for &ldquo;a little flame,&rdquo; named in reference to it's red markings.	.
forceps	forceps	?	Gelasimus forceps	MilneEdwards1837.2	Likely named for the shape of the major claw.	The type specimen appears to be a composite of at least two different species, with at least three specimens involved in the mixup. Because of this ambiguity, the name has been discarded.
forcipata	forcipata;forcipatus	forcipata	Gelasimus forcipatus	Adams1848	.	.
formosensis	formosensis	formosensis	Uca formosensis	Rathbun1921.2	Named after the island Formosa (which today we call Taiwan), where it is endemic.	.

gracilis	gracilis	crenulata	Gelasimus gracilis	Rathbun1893	Latin for &ldquo;thin.&rdquo;	<em class="species">Gelasimus gracilis</em> Rathbun, 1893, is a junior synonym of <em class="species">Uca crenulata</em> (Lockington, 1877).
grandimanus	grandimanus	?	Gonoplax grandimanus	Lamarck_nd	Latin for &ldquo;large-handed.&rdquo;	This name, which derives from a museum label, only appears in print (Lamarck, 1818) as a synonym of <em class="species">Uca maracoani</em> (Latreille, 1802). Because of so much uncertainy among species designations at that time, the exact species cannot be determined.
grangeri	grangeri	major	Gelasimus grangeri	Schramm1867	.	<em class="species">Gelasimus grangeri</em> Schramm, 1867, is a junior synonym of <em class="species">Uca major</em> (Herbst, 1782)

hirsutimanus	hirsutimanus	hirsutimanus	Uca hirsutimanus	George1982	Latin for &ldquo;hairy-hand,&rdquo; it is named for the pile in and around the groove on the outer major manus and pollex.	.
huttoni	huttoni	?	Gelassimus huttoni	Filhol1885.2	Named after the English biologist Frederick Wollaston Hutton.	The type specimen is no longer extant, the description is inadequate, and there are no known fiddler crabs from New Zealand, making the use of the name suspect and ambiguous.
inaciobritoi	inaciobritoi	antiqua	Uca inaciobritoi	MartinsNeto2001	Named after Dr. Ignacio Machado Brito who first described and named the original fossil specimen.	<em class="species">Uca inaciobritoi</em> Martins-Neto, 2001, is a junior synonym of <em class="species">Uca anitqua</em> Brito, 1972. It was proposed as a substitute name when the specimen was raised to a full species, but the original subspecific <em class="species">anitqua</em> retains priority.

leptostyla	leptostyla	leptodactyla	Uca leptostyla	Nutting1919	Appears to be an accidental combination of the names <em class="species">leptodactyla</em> and <em class="species">stylifera.</em>	Apparently a mistake/typo, since Nutting (1919) references Rathbun (1918) and does not appear to be trying to name a new species. Most likely mixed up the names of <em class="species">Uca stylifera</em> and <em class="species">U. leptodactyla.</em> Based on location (Antigua), the species could have been <em class="species">U. leptodactyla.</em>
limicola	limicola	limicola	Uca limicola	Crane1941	Named for its occurrence in mud.	.
longidigitum	longidigitum;longidigita	longidigitum	Gelasimus longidigitum	Kingsley1880	Latin for &ldquo;long-fingered.&rdquo;	.
longisignalis	longisignalis	longisignalis	Uca longisignalis	Salmon1968.1	Named for the extended duration of the waving display and sounds produced by the males.	.
macrodactyla	macrodactyla;macrodactylus	?	Gelasimus macrodactylus	MilneEdwards1843	Named for it's large dactyl.	The original use of <em class="species">Gelasimus macrodactylus</em> are for specimens from locations where fiddler crabs are not found. The collecting trip visited many different locations, so the exact one is unknown. The type specimen found in the Paris museum does not match the published description (in size or characteristics). Furthermore, the name was widely applied for a century to a number of different species, with no single one having clear dominance. Because of this ambiguity, the specific name <em class="species">macrodactylus</em> was officially suppressed by the ICZN (Opinion 940, 1971).
major	major	major	Cancer vocans major	Herbst1782	Herbst split fiddler crabs into two types/varieties based on size, using the terms major and minor for the larger and smaller types, respectively.	.
manchus	manchus	?	Gonoplax manchus	Lamarck_nd	.	This name, which derives from a museum label, only appears in print (Lamarck, 1818) as a synonym of <em class="species">Uca maracoani</em> (Latreille, 1802). Because of so much uncertainy among species designations at that time, the exact species cannot be determined.
manii	manii;manni;mani	forcipata	Uca manii	Rathbun1909	Latin for &ldquo;large-fingered.&rdquo;	<em class="species">Uca manii</em> Rathbun, 1909, is a junior synonym of <em class="species">Uca forcipata</em> (Adams &amp; White, 1848)

minor	minor	?	Cancer vocans minor	Herbst1782	Herbst split fiddler crabs into two types/varieties based on size, using the terms major and minor for the larger and smaller types, respectively.	The specific name <em class="species">minor</em> was first used by Herbst (1782), although no specimen is extant and it is not at all clear which species he was referering to. One could reasonably assume that he was using <em class="species">minor</em> to refer to the traditional <em class="species">Cancer vocans,</em> in contrast to the larger form he designated as <em class="species">major.</em> If so, <em class="species">Uca minor</em> would be a junior synonym of <em class="species">Uca vocans.</em></p><p>The name was later independently used as <em class="species">Gelasimus minor</em> Owen, 1839, to describe a species from Hawaii. No fiddler crabs are found on Hawaii, but a variety of details point to this being collected further west and likely representing <em class="species">Uca perplexa</em> (H. Milne Edwards, 1852). Since <em class="species">Gelasimus minor</em> Owen, 1839, is a clear junior homonym of <em class="species">Cancer vocans minor</em>, it was unavailble to Owen and does not take precedence over <em class="species">Uca perplexa.</em>
miocenica	miocenica	miocenica	Uca miocenica	Artal2008	Named for the Miocene epoch in which the fossil was found	Currently retained as a separate species, there is a reasonable chance this fossil is just a junior synonym for <em class="species">Uca tangeri.</em>

monilifera	monilifera;monilfera;molinifera	monilifera	Uca monilifera	Rathbun1915	.	Although first used in print by Rathbun (1915), she adopted the name from an unpublished name found on a museum specimen labled <em class="species">Eurychelus monilifer</em> by Louis Aggasiz.
mordax	mordax	mordax	Gelasimus mordax	Smith1870.2	Latin for &ldquo;biting.&rdquo;	.
murifecenta	murifecenta;murificenta	vocator	Uca murifecenta	Crane1943.2	The name came from the crab's habit of building walls.	<em class="species">Uca murifecenta</em> Crane, 1943, is a junior synonym of <em class="species">Uca vocator</em> (Herbst, 1804).

nitida	nitida;nitidus	?	Goneplax nitida	Desmarest1817	.	The specific name <em class="species">nitida</em> was originally used by Desmarest (1817) with resepct to a fossil specimen (no longer extant) and the genus <em class="species">Goneplax.</em> In 1822 he shifted this fossil to the genus <em class="species">Gelasmius</em> as well as applying it to an extant species. H. Milne Edwards (1837) cites Desmarest's fossil and use of the name with <em class="species">Gelasmius</em>.</p><p>Dana (1851) apparently independently used the identical name for a fiddler crab from Fiji (specimen no longer extant). Dana's use of the name is the one subsequently followed by most authors for the century following its publication, including H. Milne Edwards (1852) who referenced Dana and made no mention of the Desmarest fossil. Today Dana's species is known as <em class="species">Uca excisa</em>  Nobili, 1906.</p><p>As things currently stand, <em class="species">Gelasimus nitida</em> Dana, 1851, is considered a junior homonym of <em>Gonexplax nitida</em> Desmarest, 1817. If Desmaret's fossil specimen were found and turned out not to be a fiddler crab, then Dana's use of <em class="species">nitida</em> would no longer be a homonym and would have priority over <em class="species">excisa.</em>

palustris	palustris	?	Gelasimus palustris	MilneEdwards1852	The name derives from Sloane (1725), who was using it descriptively. It is Latin for &ldquo;marsh.&rdquo;	H. Milne Edwards adopted the name <em class="species">palustris</em> from the pre-Linnean book by Sloane (1725). However, no specific type was ever identified and some material in the Paris museum labeled as <em class="species">palustris</em> contained at least three different species. Because of the complete ambiguity over this name, it has been discarded.

poeyi	poeyi	?	Gelasimus poeyi	GuerinMeneville_nd	.	This name, which derives from a museum label, only appears in print (Kingsley, 1880) as a synonym of <em class="species">Uca stenodactylus</em> (H. Milne Edwards &amp; Lucas, 1843). Kingsley mixed a bunch of species together under the name <em class="species">stenodactylus</em> and as the specimen is no longer extant, it's actual meaning is unknown.
polita	polita	polita	Uca (Australuca) polita	Crane1975	from the Latin verb <em>polire</em> meaning &ldquo;to polish&rdquo;, a reference to the smooth surface of the outer manus of the major cheliped.	.

porrector	porrector	?	Gonoplax porrector	Lamarck_nd	.	This name, which derives from a museum label, only appears in print (Lamarck, 1818) as a synonym of <em class="species">Uca maracoani</em> (Latreille, 1802). Because of so much uncertainy among species designations at that time, the exact species cannot be determined.

rectilata	rectilata;rectilatus;reticulata	?	Gelasimus rectilatus	Lockington1877.2	Named for the much more rectangular carapace shape than other species.	Type specimens were destroyed in a fire and the descriptions and figures are inadequate to clearly place with a specific species. The name has been discarded.

robustus	robustus	?	Gelasimus robustus	White1847.1	.	A <em>nomen nodum.</em> The name only appears in a published list from a museum collection with no description; specimen can no longer be found, so identity cannot be determined.
rosea	roseus,rosea	rosea	Gelasimus roseus	Tweedie1937	Named for the rose color of the carapace and major chela.	.
rubripes	rubripes	?	Gelasimus rubripes	Jacquinot1846	.	Potential type specimens match multiple species, but not published figures of the type. Collection location is also highly suspect. This name has been discarded as it is impossible to know to what it refers.

schmitti	schmitti	ecuadoriensis	Uca schmitti	Crane1943.1	Named after Waldo L. Schmitt, curator of the Division of Marine Invertebrates at the US National Museum.	<em class="species">Uca schmitti</em> Crane, 1943, is a junior synonym of <em class="species">Uca ecuadoriensis</em> Maccagno, 1928. Barnwell (1988) reported evidence that this may be an independent species; further investigation is warranted.

speciosa	speciosa;speciosus	speciosa	Gelasimus speciosus	Ives1891	.	The first use of the specific name <em class="species">speciosus</em> with reference to a fiddler crab appears to be <em class="species">Gonoplax speciosus</em> from an unpublished manuscript residing in the library of the National Museum of Natural History in Paris by Christophe-Paulin de La Poix de Fréminville, referring specifically to a &ldquo;new&rdquo; species from Senegal. Because the manuscript was never published, the use of this name does not gain priority. The species referenced by Fréminville is today known as <em class="species">Uca tangeri</em> (Eydoux 1835).</p><p>The same specific name was later used by Ives to describe a new American species, <em class="species">Gelasimus speciosus.</em> Because the earlier use is a <em>nomen nudum</em>, this second use retains priority and is the proper name for the species <em class="species">Uca speciosa</em> (Ives 1891).
spinata	spinata	paradussumieri	Uca (Deltuca) dussumieri spinata	Crane1975	Named in reference to the spinous projection on the gonopod.	<em class="species">Uca dussumieri spinata</em> Crane, 1975, is a junior synonym of <em class="species">Uca paradussumieri</em> (Bott, 1973).
spinicarpa	spinicarpa	spinicarpa	Gelasimus tetragonon var. spinicarpa	Rathbun1900.2	Named after the spine/tooth on the major wrist (carpus).	This specific name was originally published as <em class="species">Gelasimus tetragonon</em> var. <em class="species">spinicarpa</em> Kossmann, 1877. This application was functionally lost and the name was reused by Rathbun when she described <em class="species">Uca spinicarpa</em> Rathbun, 1900. Although normally Kossmann's name would be a senior homonym with priority, because his usage was completely ignored for over a century while Rathbun's application was widely used, the Code of the ICZN required that priority be reversed, making Kossmann's name a <em>nomen oblitum</em> and Rathbun's a <em>nomen protectum</em> (Rosenberg 2013). The species referred to by Kossmann is likely the one now known as <em class="species">Uca hesperiae</em> Crane, 1975.

variegatus	variegatus;variegata	?	Gelasimus variegatus	Heller1862.1	.	This name has been used at least twice, in different contexts. H. Milne Edwards (1837) refers to a museum label, <em class="species">Gelasimus variegata,</em> from Latreille which he synonymizes with <em class="species">Uca tetragonon</em> (Herbst, 1790). Later, Heller (1862) uses <em class="species">Gelasimus variegatus</em> for a species supposedly found in eastern India. Heller's type does not appear to be extant, but Crane (1975) belives it is likely <em class="species">Uca inversa</em> (Hoffmann, 1874), despite the fact that the collection location is well outside the known range of <em class="species">U. inversa.</em></p><p>Heller's name would have priority over that of Hoffmann (assuming Crane is correct about the species identities).The unpublished museum label mentioned by H. Milne Edwards in 1837 would be a <em>nomen nudum</em> and would not have priority.
victoriana	victoriana	victoriana	Uca victoriana	vonHagen1987.1	Named after the location where it was found, Victoria, Brazil.	.
virens	virens	virens	Uca virens	Salmon1968.1	Named for a green band on the carapace	This species is controversial and may represent a mix of multiple species rather than a single distinct entity.
vocans	vocans;vocante;vocantis	vocans	Cancer vocans	Linnaeus1758	Latin for &ldquo;calling.&rdquo; This is the general source of the common name &ldquo;calling crabs&rdquo; for species in this genus.	The specific name <em class="species">vocans</em> has priority from Linnaeus (1758), although he adopted the name from Rumphius (1705).</p><p>As the original taxonomic name applied to fiddler crabs, <em class="species">vocans</em> was widely used for all species in the last 18th and early 19th centuries, leading to a lot of taxonomic confusion. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, many authors suggested abandoning the name entirely due to its earlier ambiguity, but eventually its priority took hold.
