Axes and Orientation	.	anterior-posterior.png|dorsal-ventral.png|proximal-distal.png	Illustration of the anterior-posterior axis of the crab. Figure modified from Crane (1975).|Illustration of the dorsal-ventral axis of the crab. Figure modified from Crane (1975).|Illustration of the proximal-distal axes of the crab. Figure modified from Crane (1975).	"This section describes the general terms used to orient different parts of the crab. The major axes run from front-to-back, top-to-bottom, and from center-to-exterior."
Abdomen	.	abdomen1.png|abdomen2.png	The abdomen from a ventral view of the crab. Figured modified from Crane (1975).|A comparison between typical male (left) and female (right) abdominal shapes. Figure modified from Crane (1975).	"The abdomen is the third major part of the body of arthropods. In true crabs, the abdomen is normally wrapped under the body and pressed against the thorax (unlike in lobsters, for example, where the abdomen is the tail of the lobster). The width of the abdomen generally varies quite a bit between male and female fiddler crabs. In males, the abdomen is relatively narrow and rectangular and takes up only about a third of the ventral surface of the body. In females, the abdomen is substantially wider and round, taking up most of the ventral surface of the crab. The sex organs (gonopods and gonopores) are located on the hidden side of the abdomen, which can be moved away from the body during mating."
Carapace	.	carapace.png|carapace2.png	The carapace from a dorsal view of the crab. Figured modified from Crane (1975).|Illustration of carpace width and length. Figure modified from Crane (1975).	"The <strong>carapace</strong> is the &ldquo;shell&rdquo; on the back of the crab. Many charactersistics of the carapace are used to distinguish between species. The length of the carapace is measured along the anterior-posterior axis, while the breadth/width of the carapace is usually measured from side-to-side. The breadth is measured between the tips of the antero-lateral angles, which is usually (although not always) the widest part of the carapace."
Limbs	.	limbs.png	The ten decapod limbs are highlighted. Figure modified from Crane (1975).	"Fiddler crabs have ten limbs. The first two limbs at the front of the crab with the claws are known as <strong>chelipeds;</strong> the other eight are <strong>walking legs (ambulatories).</strong> In a male fiddler crab, the limb with the large claw is known as the <strong>major cheliped,</strong> while that with the small claw is the <strong>minor cheliped.</strong> Female fiddler crabs have two small claws resembling the minor claw of the male."
Orbits	.	orbit1.png|orbit2.png	Illustration of the orbits from the anterior view. Figure modified from Crane (1975).|Illustration of the orbits from the side view. Figure modified from Crane (1975).	The orbits are the regions on the front (anterior) of the crab in which contain the eyes and eystalks.
Pterygostomian Region	.	pterygostomian1.png	"The pterygostomian region, from the anterior view of the crab. Figure modified from Crane (1975)."	"The anterior portion of the body below the orbits and above the ventral surface of the crab, surrounding the mouth."
Sternum	.	sternum.png	The sternum from a ventral view of the crab. Figured modified from Crane (1975).	"The sternum is the dorsal surface of the body of the crab, surrounding the abdomen."
Anterior-Posterior Axis	Axes and Orientation	anterior-posterior.png|anterior_view.png	"The anterior-posterior axis, when viewed from the ventral (top) side of the crab. Figure modified from Crane (1975).|View of the anterior side of the crab. Figure modified from Crane (1975)."	The anterior-posterior axis runs from the front to the back of the crab. <strong>Anterior</strong> refers to the front (the side with the eyes and mouth). <strong>Posterior</strong> refers to the rear of the crab.
Dorsal-Ventral Axis	Axes and Orientation	dorsal-ventral.png|dorsal_view.png|ventral_view.png	"The dorsal-ventral axis, when viewed from the anterior (front) of the crab. Figure modified from Crane (1975).|View of the dorsal surface of the crab. Figure modified from Crane (1975).|View of the ventral surface of the crab. Figure modified from Crane (1975)."	The dorsal-ventral axis runs from the top to the bottom of the crab. <strong>Dorsal</strong> refers to the top of the crab when viewed from above (strictly speaking &ldquo;dorsal&rdquo; means back). <strong>Ventral</strong> refers to the bottom of the crab when viewed from above (the part against the ground).
Proximal-Distal Axis	Axes and Orientation	proximal-distal.png|proximal-distal2.png	Illustration of the proximal-distal axis. Figure modified from Crane (1975).|The proximal and distal ends of the walking legs. Figure modified from Crane (1975).	The proximal-distal axis runs from the center of the crab to the exterior. It generall describes whether something is close or far from the center. <strong>Proximal</strong> (near) refers toward the center of the crab. <strong>Distal</strong> (away) refers toward the parts away from the center. The limbs attach to the body at their proximal ends; the tips of the limbs are the distal ends.
Antero-lateral Angle	Carapace	carapace_antero-lateral-angle.png	Illustration of the antero-lateral angles of the carapace from the dorsal view. Figure modified from Crane (1975).	"The antero-lateral angle refers to the shape of the front corners of the carapace, where the anterior edge of the carapace meets the lateral edge of the carapace. The shape of this angle can range in different species from moderately square to quite an acute triangular point."
Antero-lateral Margin	Carapace	carapace_antero-lateral-margin.png|carapace_antero-lateral-margin2.png	Illustration of the antero-lateral margins of the carapace from the dorsal view. Figure modified from Crane (1975).|Illustration of the antero-lateral margin of the carapace from a side view. Figure modified from Crane (1975).

Front	Carapace	front.png|front_narrow.png|front_broad.png	"Illustration of the breadth of the front of the crab. Figure modified from Crane (1975).|Example of a narrow-front species, Uca ornata. Figure modified from Crane (1975).|Example of a broad-front species, Uca terpsichores. Figure modified from Crane (1975)."	"The <strong>front</strong> of a fiddler crab specifically refers to the section of the carapace in between the eyestalks. Traditionally, fiddler crabs are often split into two groups based on the width of the front, the &ldquo;narrow-front& and &broad-front&rdquo; groups. While these groups may not be monophyletic, the concept still serves as a simple way to start evaluating species.</p><p>The narrow-front species tend to have the eyes extremely close together, while the broad-front range from moderately broad to very broad. There is variation within species, and the breadth of the front changes as crabs get older and larger (within broad-front species, the front gradually gets wider as the crab ages, with smaller/younger crabs having narrower fronts than larger/older crabs)."
Postero-lateral Striae	Carapace	carapace_postero-lateral-striae.png|carapace_postero-lateral-striae2.png	Illustration of the postero-lateral striae of the carapace from the dorsal view. Figure modified from Crane (1975).|Illustration of the postero-lateral striae of the carapace from a side view. Figure modified from Crane (1975).	The postero-lateral striae are additional &ldquo;creases&rdquo; (striations) found in the rear part of the dorsal surface of the carapace. The number and length of these lines varies among species.
Vertical-lateral Margin	Carapace	carapace_vertical-lateral-margin.png	Illustration of the vertical-lateral margin of the carapace from a side view. Figure modified from Crane (1975).	The vertical-lateral margin runs vertically between the junction of the antero-lateral margin and the postero-lateral margins on the dorsal surface of the carapace to the ventral margin at the bottom edge of the carapace.
Pseudopupil	Eye	orbit_eye3.jpg	A close-up of the eyestalks and eye from the fiddler crab Uca vocans. The dark vertical band in the center of the eyes is the pseudopupil. Original photo by Chris Lukhaup.	The pseudopupil in an arthropod eye is a dark spot which shifts depending on what angle you are observing the eye from. It is caused by the abosrption of light of the ommatidia being observed &ldquo;head-on&rdquo; from that viewing angle (the ommatidia viewed from other angles are reflecting light and thus not black). In fiddler crabs the pseudopupil often appears to be a long vertical band within the eye.
Style	Eye	orbit_style.jpg	"A male Uca stylifera, with a long style (indicated by the arrow) coming out of the left eye (always on the same side as the major claw). Photo by Michael S. Rosenberg."	"In a few species of fiddler crab, males may have a style growing out of the eye on the same side as the major claw. Usually the style is fairly short and not all males will have one. In the species <em class=""species"">Uca stylifera</em>, all males have a long style, about the same length as the eyestalk. The style serves no known purpose, although it may be under sexual selection."

Figure modified from Crane (1975).|The major cheliped, from the vental view of the crab. Figure modified from Crane (1975)."	"The major cheliped is the limb containing the large claw on male fiddler crabs. Cheliped refers to the entire limb, not just the claw."

Walking Legs	Limbs	walking_legs.png	"The walking legs of the crab. The numbers refer to the pair, starting with the first (most anterior) pair and ended with the fourth (most posterior) pair. Figure modified from Crane (1975)."	"The eight walking legs (also known as <strong>ambulatories</strong>) are numbered in pairs from the anterior (front) to the posterior (rear) of the crab. All of the legs have the same basic structure, although species-specific characters can vary across the legs.</p><p>Each limb is composed of seven segments (proximal to distal): <strong>coxa, basis, ischium, merus, carpus, manus,</strong> and <strong>dactyl.</strong> The first three (coxa, basis, and ischium) are small segments which attach the limb to the body of the crab. The merus is the first major segment, and the lagest on the limb.</p><p>The orientation of parts of the limbs and the segments of the limbs use the same terms as those used for the crab as the whole. The end of a segment closest to the body is the proximal end; the end of the segment farthest from the body is the distal end. The upper edge of the segment is the dorsal margin; the bottom edge is the ventral margin. The forward facing surface of the limb is the anterior surface; the rear facing surface is the posterior surface. Thus a reference to the proximal dorsal margin of the carpus would refer to the upper edge of the 5th segment (the 2nd major segment), near where the 4th and 5th segments join."
