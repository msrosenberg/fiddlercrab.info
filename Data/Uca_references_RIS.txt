AB  - Eighty-eight species of decapod crustaceans were collected from the Panama Canal. Seven of these were previously undescribed (Macrobrachium crebrum, new species, M. digitus, new species, Synalpheus recessus, new species, S. superus, new species, Eurypanopeus canalensis, new species, Panopeus gatunensis, new species, and P. mirafloresensis, new species), and another five were known only from one or a few records. Approximately 27 of the species occurred in fresh water (including one introduced from Iraq), 31 in euryhaline conditions, and 30 in almost marine conditions. Thirty species were collected from the Miraflores Third Locks Lake area and spillway (6–30‰), 23 species from the lower locks (10–30‰), and 25 species from the upper locks (0–5‰) of the Miraflores Locks. Twelve species were collected from the fresh water of the Pedro Miguel Locks and an equal number from freshwater streams on Barro Colorado Island. The Gatun Locks yielded four species from the freshwater upper locks, eight from the 2–8‰ waters of the middle locks, and 22 from the 8–15‰ waters of the lower locks. A typical marine assemblage of species occurred down to about 10‰, whereas a typical freshwater fauna occurred up to about 3‰; a species-minimum zone was observed from about 3 to 5‰.

There has been relatively little exchange between the Atlantic and Pacific regions. Seven Atlantic species (one freshwater and six euryhaline species) were collected from the Pacific side and one Pacific euryhaline species from the Atlantic side. Most of the Atlantic migrants were collected from the Miraflores Third Locks Lake area and apparently have not established breeding populations outside of the Panama Canal. Surprisingly, only one of the 27 freshwater species has spread throughout the canal. The fresh water of Gatun Lake forms an effective barrier to the distribution of stenohaline marine species, and therefore any salinization of Gatun Lake (or construction of a sea-level canal) would almost certainly result in an extensive faunal exchange and would be unconscionable given our ignorance of the biota and ecology of the communities of the Panama Canal.

AB  - Feeding is an important factor for the successful rearing of larvae of the crab species. Further information on the morphological features of the foregut may to reveal larval feeding behaviour and or/whether there is a lecithotrophy in some or even in all stages of the larval cycle. In the present study, the structural development of the foregut and their digestive functions were examined in larvae of two brachyurans, Uca vocator and Panopeus occidentalis, reared in the laboratory. During larval development, the foreguts of the larvae in the first and last zoeal stages and in the megalopa stage were microscopically examined, described and illustrated. The zoeal foreguts of both species were well developed, showing specialization with a functional cardiopyloric valve and a filter press. The megalopa stage had a complex and specialized gastric mill similar to that found in adult crabs with the appearance of rigidly calcified structures. These results support the hypothesis that the feeding behaviour of each larval stage is directly related to the morphological structure of the foregut. Such facts strongly indicate that all larval stages of both U. vocator and P. occidentalis need an external food source before completing the larval development in a planktonic environment.

AB  - While evolutionary trends have long received much attention and have been widely disputed, new methods are now allowing the testing of directional hypotheses with increased rigor. Here, we test a general hypothesis about the way many kinds of discrete characters are thought to evolve, termed oligomerization. This is the tendency for serial structures (such as arthropod body and appendage segments) or armature (such as spines) to evolve primarily through loss and fusion. Focusing on the Crustacea, we use maximum likelihood methods to test for directional evolution in a large sample (> 500) of discrete traits, analyzed against molecular-based phylogenies. We find evidence for a significant trend toward trait loss, in accordance with the reduction principle. However, this trend is far from ubiquitous, with many characters exhibiting a reconstructed bias toward gains. These results suggest that caution must be used before drawing conclusions about which taxa are "primitive" or about the directionality of morphological shifts in the absence of phylogenetic analysis. Nevertheless, oligomerization-as a trend rather than a law-may be an important process that influences evolutionary trajectories from both morphological and functional perspectives.

AB  - Wild populations of two species of Venezuelan fiddler crabs, Uca cumulanta and U. rapax, were examined to determine the occurrence of normal and aberrant sexual types, sex ratios, and frequneces of right- and left-handed males. Several grades of sexuality occur. Young U. cumulanta, measuring 1.5 to 5.0 mm, can be identified as: sexually undifferentiated symmetricals, females, right-handed males (dextrals), left-handed males (sinistrals), "exceptional" males with two small claws, and females with narrow abdomens beside other doubtful forms. Males and females of U. cumulanta can be distinguished in some cases as small as 1.7 mm carapace width. Supermales with two large claws, which have been reported to occur in other species of Uca, were not found in either of the two species. Sinistral males in some cases were slightly but not significantly in excess. Both merely appear to be alternative forms of each other. Males and females occur in approximately equal numbers in smaller size classes but males outnumber females in the larger classes, possibly because adult females avoid caputre by burrowing deeper.

AB  - This study explores whether timing adjustment in ocypodid waving also occurs between heterospecific pairs. Analysis of the dyadic interactions between neighbouring males of Ilyoplax pusilla and Uca lactea in the field showed that the former tended to wave with some delay after each U. lactea wave, while the latter was little influenced by I. pusilla waves. The heterospecific wave timing of I. pusilla by U. lactea waves can be viewed as a weakened form of the conspecific wave timing mechanism in this species.

AB  - Polarisation sensitivity is based on the regular alignment of dichroic photopigment molecules within photoreceptor cells. In crustaceans, this is achieved by regularly stacking photopigment-rich microvilli in alternating orthogonal bands within fused rhabdoms. Despite being critical for the efficient detection of polarised light, very little research has focused on the detailed arrangement of these microvilli bands. We report here a number of hitherto undescribed, but functionally relevant changes in the organisation of microvilli banding patterns, both within receptors, and across the compound eye of fiddler crabs. In all ommatidia, microvilli bands increase in length from the distal to the proximal ends of the rhabdom. In equatorial rhabdoms, horizontal bands increase gradually from 3 rows of microvilli distally to 20 rows proximally. In contrast, vertical equatorial microvilli bands contain 15-20 rows of microvilli in the distal 30 mu m of the rhabdom, shortening to 10 rows over the next 30 mu m and then increase in length to 20 rows in parallel with horizontal bands. In the dorsal eye, horizontal microvilli occupy only half the cross-sectional area as vertical microvilli bands. Modelling absorption along the length of fiddler crab rhabdoms suggests that (1) increasing band length assures that photon absorption probability per band remains constant along the length of photoreceptors, indicating that individual bands may act as units of transduction or adaptation; (2) the different organisation of microvilli bands in equatorial and dorsal rhabdoms tune receptors to the degree and the information content of polarised light in the environment.

AB  - This dissertation investigates the costs and condition-dependence of sexually selected traits in the sand fiddler crab, Uca pugilator . Theory suggests that sexually selected structures and behavioral displays are honest signals of male quality to opponents and mates that are costly to produce and maintain. In mid-Atlantic salt marshes, reproductively active males use a single greatly enlarged major claw as both a weapon to defend specialized breeding burrows from other males and an ornament to attract females for mating. Carrying the major claw, which can comprise as much as 40% of the total body mass, imposes significant energetic and locomotor costs to male fiddler crabs. These costs are exacerbated by the location of breeding burrows in open areas high on the shore characterized by low food availability and high temperatures. Using biophysical engineering methods I found that, from the perspective of a fiddler crab, the thermal environment of the mating area is quite harsh relative to other marsh microhabitats and that high temperatures and desiccation stress significantly constrain physiological performance and reproductive activity. Nevertheless, fiddler crabs can adjust their behavior in response to the magnitude of perceived benefits and costs. When the chance of successfully acquiring a mate is high, males will accept a higher body temperature (and concomitantly higher metabolic and water loss rates) than when the chances of mating are low. Likewise, experimentally lowering costs by adding food and reducing thermal stress in situ increased fiddler crab activity levels. Males in good condition (i.e., of high phenotypic quality) spend more time in the breeding area guarding a burrow and courting females than do males in poor condition. As a consequence, by selectively mating with only breeding area residents, females obtain mates of higher than average quality relative to males in other parts of the marsh. My results provide a possible mechanistic explanation for the maintenance of the sand fiddler crab mating system.

AB  - Fiddler crabs (genus Uca) exhibit extreme sexual dimorphism. Males have a greatly enlarged major claw that comprises as much as 40% of the total body mass. Males with relatively larger claws have an advantage in male-male competition, and are more often chosen as mates by females. Sexually selected characters may have associated costs, and it has been suggested that the presence of the major claw might result in reduced foraging efficiency or increased risk of predation for male crabs. Empirical support for these hypotheses, however, has been mixed. Using a simple measure of performance efficiency, we tested the hypothesis that carrying the major claw represents an energetic cost to male fiddler crabs. We ran male sand fiddler crabs (Uca pugilator) on a motorized treadmill at a constant velocity, and measured time to fatigue. Crabs with a major claw tired significantly sooner than crabs without a major claw (which can be autotomized by the crab, and subsequently regenerated). Similarly, crabs carrying added weight tired sooner than crabs without an additional load. The relationship between weight and endurance is complex, and there appears to be a threshold weight associated with a marked decrease in crab performance. Crabs without a major claw crossed a threshold of endurance and could run for much longer periods of time. Our results suggest that claw size must be a reliable indicator of male fiddler crab quality, as only crabs in good condition would counteract the energetic cost of bearing such a large major claw. We are currently seeking to quantify this cost by comparing size-specific metabolic rates of male crabs with and without major claws.

AB  - Previous evidence demonstrates that closing force decreases proportionally as fiddler crab claw size increases. Larger crabs do have greater absolute closing force, but less than would be expected if claw proportions were isometric. In the mud fiddler crab, Uca pugnax, this is explained by a decrease in mechanical advantage with increasing claw size. We here re-measure mechanical advantage with a more direct method than used previously; the relationship of mechanical advantage to claw size was similar to the older indirect measure. Because the fiddler crab claw is a simple lever, we predicted that the observed decline in closing force should be compensated by a proportional increase in closing speed. We tested this hypothesis using high-speed video to observe crabs closing their major claws spontaneously under controlled conditions. Closing speed scaled positively to claw length as predicted, and the value of the exponent conformed to expectation from a simple biomechanical model. Evolution of the fiddler crab claw therefore involved a trade-off of closing force for closing speed. An adaptive explanation of relative weakening with increasing body size may lie in the increased ability to rapidly grasp an opponent, a crucial advantage in fiddler crab combat.

AB  - 1. Sexually selected structures with dual function of combat and display are likely to be honest signals of male quality to opponents and mates, but should be costly to produce and maintain. 2. Male fiddler crabs use a single greatly enlarged claw as both a weapon in agonistic contests with other males and an ornament to attract females for mating. Given the extreme size of this structure (up to half the total body mass), there is surprisingly little evidence for costs as predicted by theory. 3. We experimentally investigated several potential costs of the large claw to male sand fiddler crabs Uca pugilator. Mass-specific metabolic rates were significantly higher and treadmill endurance capacity significantly lower for males bearing an intact major claw compared with those without. 4. In contrast, presence of the claw did not affect maximal sprint speeds, suggesting that the massive structure does not compromise the ability of male crabs to evade predators. These counterintuitive results conform to recent theoretical models of energy costs of locomotion. 5. Our study provides empirical support for a key assumption of sexual selection theory - energetic and endurance-related locomotor costs incurred while bearing this ornamental weapon act in opposition to sexual selection favouring larger claws.

AB  - Reproductively active males of the sand fiddler crab Uca pugilator are routinely exposed to high body temperatures and desiccation while defending breeding-burrows from other males or displaying to attract females. Such males are generally larger than individuals in other parts of the marsh, in part, because large males win more contests and have greater energy stores. We propose an additional explanation: that higher thermal inertia and lower mass-specific water loss rates may make large males less susceptible to thermal and hydration stresses than small males. We experimentally investigated the effects of variation in body temperature (T-b) and desiccation on physiological performance and behavior of male sand fiddler crabs as a function of body size. Treadmill endurance and sprint speed increased to a maximum before decreasing rapidly with further increases in T-b. Moderate dehydration (7-10% body water loss) resulted in significantly reduced locomotor performance, with small crabs exhibiting the greatest reductions in both body water and performance capacity. Fiddler crabs appear to be sensitive to the potentially conflicting demands of body temperature and hydration state. In a laboratory thermal gradient, crabs on wet sand chose T-b's associated with high locomotor performance capacity. In contrast, crabs on dry sand selected lower T-b's that presumably minimized water loss, with small crabs choosing the lowest T-b's. In addition to providing empirical support for a general model of ectotherm locomotion, our results are consistent with the idea that larger individuals are better able to tolerate harsh environmental conditions above-ground, increasing the proportion of time they can spend engaging in fitness-enhancing reproductive activities rather than sheltering in a burrow.

AB  - In a high salinity estuary at North Inlet, South Carolina, co-occurrence and possible competition among adults of four dominant zooplanktivorous fishes were minimized by seasonal adjustments in lateral and vertical distributions as well as in dietary preferences. In winter, Atlantic silversides, Menidia menidia, occupied the entire water column while other planktivores were rare or absent from the estuary, and they consumed large prey such as mysid shrimps and fish larvae. An immigration of bay anchovies, Anchoa mitchilli, in the spring resulted in a redistribution of species with Atlantic silversides shifting to the surface waters and bay anchovies dominating the lower half of the water column. Both fishes consumed mostly copepods in the spring, but each favored a different species. There was little similarity in the large prey items consumed by the two fishes. Striped anchovies, Anchoa hepsetus, arrived in mid-summer and were most abundant at the surface while bay anchovies continued to dominate the bottom waters. Atlantic silversides were rare in all summer collections. The diets of the two anchovies were similar, but vertical separation during the period of maximum zooplankton abundance probably minimized competition. Rough silversides, Membras martinica, which were obligate surface dwellers, shared the upper water column with striped anchovies, but the two species had very different diets during their period of co-occurrence. Although seasonal changes in fish diets reflected shifts in zooplankton composition and all fishes consumed a variety of prey types, preferences for some prey taxa and total avoidance of others were indicated. Electivity indices indicated an especially strong selection for fiddler crab megalopae by all fishes in the summer and-fall. All fishes, except rough silversides, which fed almost exclusively on copepods and crab zoeae, consumed large prey items when they were available.

AB  - The Westbury Formation (Rhaetian) beds of Westbury Garden Cliff, Westbury-on-Severn, west of Gloucester, Britain, show an unusual combination of features. Both deep water and emergent characteristics are present within the sediments and the trace fossils. The ichnoassemblage consists of abundant Selenichnites, Planolites beverlyensis and Lockeia with rarer Oniscoidichnus, Chondrites, Rhizocorallium irregulare, Taenidium serpentium, an unusual form of Walcottia and Merostomichnites-like traces. These trace fossils display an interesting relationship with the sediments: low-energy Cruziana ichnofacies is found within high-energy sandstones. The sandstones are interbedded with laminated mudstones, apparently deposited in deep water, but some aspects of the ichnoassemblage, preservation and sedimentation indicate shallower water. One new trace fossil, Radichnus allingtona igen. et isp. nov., closely resembles the traces of modern fiddler crabs and imply emergence, by analogy. This ichnofauna is similar to early stage disaster colonisation in recent experiments in Long Island Sound (south of Connecticut, USA) and with storm-influenced deposits within the Cardium Formation (Seebe, Alberta, Canada). This indicates a lagoonal environment with influxes of sand and oxygen. Total organic carbon levels were found to fluctuate greatly between stratigraphic layers but remained relatively high. This implies low oxygen conditions. The abundance of sulphur (in pyrite) also supports an interpretation of anoxic conditions, and low sedimentation rates within the shale layers. A restricted shallow basin or lagoonal environment is proposed for the palaeoenvironment, with fluctuating oxygen influencing diversity.

AB  - The objective of this study was to determine the taxonomic composition and ecological aspects of decapod crustacean species belonging to the infraorders Anomura and Brachyura in shallow marine and estuarine waters from southern Bahia, a coastline about 640 km in extent, corresponding to approximately 7% of the Brazilian coast. Sixteen species of the infraorder Anomura and 68 of the infraorder Brachyura are reported for the study area. The most important families in terms of number of species were the Panopeidae with 11 species, and the Ocypodidae and Portunidae with 9. Among the Brachyura, the southern distribution of the species Austinixa leptodactyla Coelho, 1997 (Pinnotheridae), endemic to Brazil, is extended from the coast of Sergipe to Bahia (Prado, Cumuruxatiba Beach, 17 degrees 06'18.6 '' S, 39 degrees 10'50.4 '' W). The ocypodid Uca (Leptuca) cumulanta Crane, 1943 and also the pinnotherids Austinixa aidae (Righi, 1967) and Fabia byssomiae (Say, 1818) are reported for the first time from the Bahia coast. The specimen of F. byssomiae examined was collected in the mantle cavity of the clam Macoma constricta (Bruchiere, 1792) (Bivalvia: Tellinidae), a new host record for the species.

AB  - This study monitored the endogenous emergence time of the fiddler crab Uca lactea annulipes (Milne-Edwards, 1837) in the field, for the first time, at an intertidal shore in Kuwait, from 1997 to 2001. The results revealed a significant cyclic change in the median emergence time as the season progressed from winter, through spring and summer, to autumn (.44, 1.29, 3.12, and 1.1 h prior to the dead-low tide, respectively). The data also revealed a significant shift in the median emergence time according to moon phase (2.27 h at new moon versus 2.56 h at full moon prior to the dead-low tide).

AB  - Between July 1982 and October 1985, we studied the taxonomy, distribution, relative abundance, and habitats of the decapod crustacaens of the Barra de Navidad Lagoon, Jalisco, located on the Pacific coast of tropical Mexico. Twelve lagoonal habitats were defined, on the basis of substrate and distance from the lagoon inlet, 7 in the intertidal or mesolittoral zone (sand, muddy sand, mud, pebbles, cliffs, channels, and the marina) and 5 in the subtidal zone (sand, muddy sand, mud, pebbles, and cliffs and rocks). The most extense habitat consists of a large muddy area. During the study, 1,500 individuals of 19 families and 74 species were collected. The number of species of high for this type of system, owing to the presence of areas with hard substrate close to the lagoon entrance and under influence of the marine environment. The families with the largest number of species were the (17) Xanthidae and the Porcellanidae (12). The genus with the highest number of species was Petrolisthes, with 10. The highest species diversity was found on natural hard substrates, particularly among pebbles (32 species in the intertidal, 27 in the subtidal). Dominance index in rocky intertidal habitats was relatively low (DI = 44). The widest horizontal distributions were found among species of the Grapsidae, Xanthidae (intertidal), and Portundiae (subtidal). Pachygrapsus transversus was found in all intertidal habitats with hard substrate. Panopeus cf. miraflorensis was collected in all habitats with natural hard substrate. Callinectes arcuatus and C. bellicosus enjoyed the widest distribution in subtidal habitats with soft sustrates. The families with the widest vertical distributions were the Diogenidae, Porcellanidae, and Xanthidae, while Panopeus cf. mirfalorensis and Clibanarius albidigitus were the most abundant species per unit area. There is a small fishery for the two species of Callinectes. Other abundant species are Aratus pisoni, Upogebia sp., and Uca crenulata. Two species, Cardisoma crassum and Clibanarius panamensis, are abundant during the rainy season only.

AB  - Constructed wetlands, especially mangroves, have been studied for their usefulness in sewage treatment but the effects of mangrove vegetation and a sewage load on mangrove macrofauna have been given little attention. Ocypodid crabs are important components of mangrove forests and constitute good bioindicators of the functioning of the ecosystem as a whole. In constructed mangrove mesocosms, three vegetation treatments (bare substratum, and Avicennia marina and Rhizophora mucronata seedlings) were subjected to 0, 20, 60 and 100% sewage loads from a nearby hotel. The physiological condition of introduced Uca annulipes and Uca inversa was evaluated in terms of their RNA/DNA ratio after one, five and twelve months, and used as an indicator of ecological function in the system. Crab condition in 0% sewage load was similar to that of wild crabs throughout, suggesting no significant effects of the mesocosms on their RNA/DNA ratio. Overall, both species coped well with the administered sewage loads, suggesting good ecological function in the system. Both species manifested similar patterns in RNA/DNA ratio, being more affected by seasonal fluctuations than by sewage load and vegetation presence and type. Higher RNA/DNA ratios were recorded in the long compared to the short rainy season. Sewage enhanced crab condition in the bare substratum and R mucronata treatments, especially after one year, probably as a result of enhanced food availability. Uca inversa may be more sensitive to sewage pollution than U. annulipes. In A. marina, no difference in crab condition was observed between sewage loads, and this mangrove yielded the best reduction in sewage impacts. Our results support the usefulness of constructed mangrove areas in sewage treatment, especially if planted with A. marina and inhabited by physiologically healthy ocypodid crabs to enhance the system's performance.

AB  - 1. Pollution of mangrove ecosystems puts their future and that of local communities at risk. Only the use of informed and integrative approaches will successfully maintain and restore these valuable ecosystems. 2. Biochemical indicators of organism physiological condition have been widely used to evaluate habitat quality and for early detection of the impact of stressors. Mangrove crabs may be useful bioindicators of the quality of mangrove habitats, as they are characteristic and ecologically important organisms in mangrove environments. 3. The physiological condition (evaluated by the RNA/DNA ratio) of Perisesarma guttatum (Grapsidae) and Uca annulipes (Ocypodidae) was assessed to determine its potential as an indicator of habitat quality in one polluted and two relatively unpolluted Mozambican mangroves, during the rainy and dry seasons. 4. Both species showed seasonal effects on RNA/DNA ratio, but only U. annulipes was significantly affected by pollution. RNA/DNA ratio of U. annulipes may thus be a useful indicator of pollution and seasonality in mangrove habitats. There was a synergistic negative effect of the rainy season and pollution on the RNA/DNA ratio of U. annulipes. Due to higher DNA, rather than lower RNA contents, the RNA/DNA ratio of P. guttatum was always significantly lower than that of U. annulipes. 5. The knowledge gathered in this study can be used in integrative strategies, policies and programmes aiming to sustain, maintain and restore mangrove areas, and for the evaluation of mangrove habitat quality.

AB  - The uptake, assimilation, and retention of Se, Co, Ag, Ce, Eu, and Gd by crustacean larvae were measured to assess the suitability of these elements as tags for determining larval dispersal patterns and mortality rates. Gamma-emitting radioisotopes were used to determine the uptake and retention of each element by larvae of three crabs, Dyspanopeus sayi, Uca pugnax, and Sesarma reticulatum, and one barnacle, Semibalanus balanoides. Selenium was readily taken up by larvae from their food, was assimilated at efficiencies of 61-93%, was retained at concentrations detectable above background levels for weeks, and did not consistently affect larval survival or development in the laboratory. The other elements were not absorbed sufficiently from food or were not retained long enough to serve as appropriate tags for monitoring larval dispersal. Thus, only Se seemed to be transferred efficiently between trophic levels and is suitable as a larval tag.

AB  - Mar Chiquita, a brackish coastal lagoon in central Argentina, is inhabited by dense populations of two intertidal grapsid crab species, Cyrtograpsus angulatus and Chasmagnathus granulata. During a preliminary one-year study and a subsequent intensive sampling programme (November-December 1992), the physical properties and the occurrence of decapod crustacean larvae in the surface water of the lagoon were investigated. The lagoon is characterized by highly variable physical conditions, with oligohaline waters frequently predominating over extended periods. The adjacent coastal waters show a complex pattern of semidiurnal tides that often do not influence the lagoon, due to the existence of a sandbar across its entrance. Besides frequently occurring larvae (exclusively freshly hatched zoeae and a few megalopae) of the two dominating crab species, those of three other brachyurans (Plathyxanthus crenulatus, Uca uruguayensis, Pinnixa patagonica) and of one anomuran (the porcellanid Pachycheles haigae) were also found occasionally. Caridean shrimp (Palaemonetes argentinus) larvae occurred in a moderate number of samples, with a maximum density of 800 cntdot m-3. The highest larval abundance was recorded in C. angulatus, with almost 8000 cntdot m-3. Significantly more C. angulatus and C. granulata zoeae occurred at night than during daylight conditions, and more larvae (statistically significant only in the former species) during ebb (outflowing) than during flood (inflowing) tides. In consequence, most crab zoeae were observed during nocturnal ebb, the least with diurnal flood tides, Our data suggest that crab larvae do not develop in the lagoon, where the adult populations live, but exhibit an export strategy, probably based upon exogenously coordinated egg hatching rhythms. Zoeal development must take place in coastal marine waters, from where the megalopa eventually returns for settlement and metamorphosis in the lagoon. Significantly higher larval frequency of C.

AB  - In crustaceans, the retinoid X receptor (RXR) is the heterodimer partner of the ecdysteroid receptor (EcR), a transcriptional regulator of growth and/or reproduction. Recent analyses of RXR-encoding genes of the fiddler crab Uca pugilator and the land crab Gecarcinus lateralis have revealed that, unlike their vertebrate homologs, these RXRs contain variant ligand binding domain (LBD) sequences resulting from alternative splicing. We present sequence information on the EcR and RXR genes of the crab, Uca annulipes, an inhabitant of the intertidal zone of the estuaries of Muzhupilangad (Kannur, India). Using RT-PCR, we have recovered cDNAs from ovarian tissues and examined them for splicing variants in the LBD. Within the LBD region sequenced, the two Uca RXR homologs share 97% nucleotide sequence identity, and encode identical proteins with the exception of two adjacent amino acid substitutions at the beginning of the helix 9 region. Isoform variants identical in composition to those observed in Uca pugilator were identified: a hinge region variant differing by the addition or omission of a 5-6 amino acid sequence, and a variant in the H1-3 loop region, differing by the addition or omission of a 33 amino acid sequence. A H7-8 isoform, as identified in G. lateralis, was not observed. Nucleotide identities in the U. annulipes EcR and RXR DNA binding domains(DBD) are also high (~96%), encoding identical proteins over the region thus far sequenced. Intron structure within the DBDs is also highly conserved, although the UpEcR gene contains an intron/exon organization distinct from that observed in insects. Primers designed for the EcR and RXR genes have been validated for the U. annulipes homologs, and Q-RTPCR experiments are in progress quantifying receptor transcript levels during oocyte maturation.

AB  - Three gelatinolytic proteases (A1, A2, and B) were purified using a synthetic substrate, DNP-Pro-Gln-Gly-lle-Ala-Gly-Gln-D- Arg, from the hepatopancreas of Northern shrimp (Pandalus eous) by several chromatographic steps involving hydroxyapatite column chromatography, gel filtration on Superdex75, and ion- exchange chromatography on a MonoQ column. Collagenolytic proteases A2 and B, but not protease A1, were demonstrated to digest native porcine type I collagen at 25 degreesC and pH 7.5. Further characterizations of these two collagenolytic proteases showed that the pH optimum of enzyme A2 against DNP- peptide was found to be 11, whereas that of enzyme B was 8.5. The optimum temperature ranged between 40 and 45 degreesC for both enzymes, although enzyme B appeared to be thermally more stable than enzyme A2 at pH 7.5. Both enzymes were strongly inhibited by PMSF and antipain, which suggests that they belong to collagenolytic serine proteases.

AB  - Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis was performed on polymerase chain reaction-amplified DNA fragments containing the D-loop, ND2, and CO I genes of fiddler crab Uca arcuata mitochondrial DNA. In total, 316 individuals from six populations in Japan and two populations in Taiwan were analyzed using five restriction endonucleases (AfaI, BcnI, Cfr13I, HaeIII and HinfI), yielding 85 haplotypes. Samples were taken from Nakagusuku Bay, Okinawajima Island, which is the only known distribution of U. arcuata in the Ryukyu Archipelago. The Okinawajima Island population is isolated geographically from others and showed a marked low genetic variability (h = 0.2539, pi = 0.0005) and significant differentiation from other population samples in haplotype composition. We suggest that a substantial decrease in the genetic variability of the Okinawajima Island population was caused by genetic drift under the conditions of small population size and low gene flow from other populations. It is important to conserve the intertidal zone in Nakagusuku Bay for the maintenance of this endangered population.

AB  - The genetic relationship between fiddler crab Uca crassipes populations from the continental coast, continental islands, and oceanic islands in the west Pacific was investigated using 1039 bp (base pairs)-long combined 12Sr-RNA-16Sr-RNA sequences and a 504-bp mitochondrial DNA control region. The combined 12Sr-RNA-16Sr-RNA sequences indicated that the Vietnamese population, located along the continental coast, and the Chichi-jima population, which is located on an oceanic island north of the Northern Mariana Islands, formed different clades than populations from the other Ryukyu Islands and Moorea Island. Conversely, the Ryukyu Islands and Moorea Island populations exhibited a close genetic relationship, although the mtDNA control region indicated significant differentiation between the Ryukyu Islands and Moorea Island populations. The isolated Vietnam and Chichi-jima populations exhibited higher genetic diversity in the control region than the other populations.

AB  - We compared seasonal changes in population structures and surface activities in the fiddler crab Uca arcuata between temperate (Yoshinogawa. Japan) and subtropical localities (Shinko, Japan). At Yoshinogawa, male courtship behavior was observed from April to July and pair formation from May to July, whereas at Shinko such mating behavior patterns were observed over two periods (June to September and February to March). Thus, the subtropical population appears to have a longer breeding period than the temperate population. Waving occurred from June to August at Yoshinogawa and during all months (except October and November) at Shinko. Waving frequency was higher during courting periods at all localities, although lower at Shinko compared with Yoshinogawa. Maximum body size and the size at maturity were smaller at Shinko than at Yoshinogawa. Surface and underground couplings were observed at Yoshinogawa, whereas only surface coupling was observed at Shinko. These differences and similarities are discussed from the viewpoint of habitat conditions and population characteristics.

AB  - Bioturbation by crabs may affect processes associated with organic matter decomposition in mangrove soils. This study examines how two crabs (Uca maracoani and Ucides cordatus), which are of substantial ecological and economic importance in semiarid coastal areas of Brazil, affect biogeochemical processes in mangrove soils. For this purpose, the physicochemical and geochemical parameters of the soils at different sites were analyzed. The redox potential was always positive at bioturbated sites (+12 to +218 mV), indicating more oxidizing conditions conducive to the oxidation of pyrite and precipitation of oxyhydroxides. In contrast, anoxic conditions prevailed at the control site (Eh < 0 mV), and the most abundant form of iron was Fe-pyrite. The highest degree of iron pyritization (DOP) was observed in soils from the control site (similar to 48%) and the lowest in the bioturbated soils (5-16%), indicating that crabs have an oxidative effect on iron sulfides. The results also suggest that U. cordatus has a higher oxidizing capacity than U. maracoani, probably because it constructs larger and deeper burrows. The results demonstrate that both crabs must be considered as important bioturbators in Brazilian semiarid mangrove soils, being capable of enhancing organic matter decomposition and also shifting the dominant pathway of organic matter degradation.

AB  - Fiddler crabs (Uca spp., Decapoda: Ocypodidae) are commonly found forming large aggregations in intertidal zones, where they perform rhythmic waving displays with their greatly enlarged claws. While performing these displays, fiddler crabs often synchronize their behavior with neighboring males, forming the only known synchronized visual courtship displays involving reflected light and moving body parts. Despite being one of the most conspicuous aspects of fiddler crab behavior, little is known about the mechanisms underlying synchronization of male displays. In this study we develop a spatially explicit model of fiddler crab waving displays using coupled logistic map equations. We explored two alternative models in which males either direct their attention at random angles or preferentially toward neighbors. Our results indicate that synchronization is possible over a fairly large region of parameter space. Moreover, our model was capable of generating local synchronization neighborhoods, as commonly observed in fiddler crabs under natural conditions.

AB  - The megalopa stage of the fiddler crab endemic to the Neotropical region, Uca uruguayensis, is redescribed, measured and illustrated from 216 specimens collected at Channel 1, Samborombon Bay, Argentina, the southernmost permanent population of the species. Special attention is given to the description of the types of setae, which are compared to those cited for U. uruguayensis and other fiddler crab megalopae reared in the laboratory. The differences are given in the outline of the carapace, the plumose spines of the telson, and also in the following appendages: antennule, antenna, mandible, maxillule, maxilla, first, second and third maxillipeds. These cited differences could be due to: the origin of the organisms, caught in the field from their settlement area versus reared in the laboratory, and/or the sampling locality. The purpose of the present paper is to provide a detailed description of the megalopa that may allow resolution of taxonomic and phylogenetic relationships within this complex genus.

AB  - Specimens of Uca uruguayensis were collected (n = 1200, 216 megalopac, 984 undifferentiated and adults), counted and classified as males, females or undifferentiated individuals. Each was measured (total carapace width, CW) and weighed (dry weight, DW). The crabs were analyzed and separated into cohorts by the conversion of polymodal width-frequency distributions into normal curves. Six cohorts were recruited during the study period. Two cohorts coexisted in September and December 2001, and April and October 2002, and three in March and June 2001, December 2002, and February 2003. Ovigerous females were captured in December 2001 and 2002, and February 2003; on this last date, megalopal settlement was registered at all the sampling sites. The correlation between CW and DW was analyzed and the growth pattern was modelled by applying the power function (DW = a CWb). Males, females and undifferentiated individuals were examined separately and all together as a group. The data were fitted, indicating a positive allometry for DW, males showing the highest allometric values. To estimate the annual production we used a size-frequency method. Mature individuals, in particular those included in the 10-11.99 mm size class, contributed most to production. On the other hand, few individuals belonged to the size class prior to puberty. Total biomass (expressed in DW) varied between 20 and 611 mg mg(-2) and the highest values were recorded during summer.

AB  - Much of the literature on male-female coevolution concerns the processes by which male traits and female preferences for these can coevolve and be maintained by selection. There has been less explicit focus on the origin of male traits and female preferences. Here, I argue that it is important to distinguish origin from subsequent coevolution and that insights into the origin can help us appreciate the relative roles of various coevolutionary processes for the evolution of diversity in sexual dimorphism. I delineate four distinct scenarios for the origin of male traits and female preferences that build on past contributions, two of which are based on pre-existing variation in quality indicators among males and two on exploitation of pre-existing sensory biases among females. Recent empirical research, and theoretical models, suggest that origin by sensory exploitation has been widespread. I argue that this points to a key, but perhaps transient, role for sexually antagonistic coevolution (SAC) in the subsequent evolutionary elaboration of sexual traits, because (i) sensory exploitation is often likely to be initially costly for individuals of the exploited sex and (ii) the subsequent evolution of resistance to sensory exploitation should often be associated with costs due to selective constraints. A review of a few case studies is used to illustrate these points. Empirical data directly relevant to the costs of being sensory exploited and the costs of evolving resistance is largely lacking, and I stress that such data would help determining the general importance of sexual conflict and SAC for the evolution of sexual dimorphism.

AB  - Indirect interactions are among the many important factors that influence the community structure of the rocky intertidal zone. Trait-mediated indirect interactions, in which the presence of a predator or competitor can influence the relationship between two other species, have emerged as vital for understanding community dynamics. This study examined the effect of different crab species on the feeding habits of an intertidal snail, Nucella lapillus. Crab species were defined as being sympatric predatory (Carcinus maenas and Cancer irroratus), sympatric non-predatory (Uca pugnax and Pagurus longicarpus), or allopatric predatory (Mithrax sculptus and Percnon gibbesi). Nucella lapillus were potentially exposed to risk cues from each of the crab species. Crabs were kept in perforated boxes, which allowed any chemical cues to be emitted but prevented direct contact. Nucella lapillus had significantly lower feeding rates in the presence of sympatric predatory crab species than N. lapillus exposed to either sympatric non-predatory crabs or allopatric predator), crabs. There was no difference in feeding rate between N. lapillus exposed to the sympatric non-predatory crabs and to the allopatric predatory crabs. Nucella lapillus in the presence of sympatric predatory crabs had a feeding rate of only 0.07 barnacles per snail per clay, whereas N. lapillus housed with non-predatory crabs and allopatric predatory crabs had rates of 0.11 and 0.12, respectively, suggesting that N. lapillus alter their behavior in response to chemical risk cues from local predators. These results Suggest that the ability to detect and respond to risk cues is a selectively evolved trait.

AB  - Brachyuran crab community structure was compared between mangrove sites under different management systems from four locations along the Melaka Straits-Andaman Sea Coast. Klong Ngao, a mangrove estuary in Ranong Province of southern Thailand, lies within a Biosphere Reserve designated in 1997. Sites were positioned in plantations at a former charcoal concession forest, a disused tin mine, and an abandoned shrimp pond along this estuary. The Merbok estuary in Kedah, Malaysia, is partiatly managed: the mangroves are cut for charcoal and poles on a small scale and the forests are left to regenerate naturally. The Matang Mangrove Forest Reserve in Perak, Malaysia, is heavily exploited but well managed, for Rhizophora wood to produce charcoal, and has been for 100 years. Sites were positioned in plantations of different ages. Kuala Selangor Nature Park, Selangor, Malaysia, was established as a nature reserve in 1987 and contains mature mangrove forest regenerating naturally from previous selective felling. At Klong Ngao and Matang, mature reserve forest sites were also studied for comparison with plantation sites. The sites included both upstream and downstream locations and were of similar area, minimizing effects from possible species-area relationships. Sites were chosen with similar environmental conditions and with a dominance of Rhizophora spp. At each site per location, the brachyuran crabs were sampled quantitatively in 100 m(2) quadrats by three independent 15-min timed crab catches. The crab community recorded was analyzed by univariate and mulltivariate statistical techniques. Management history plays an important role in moderating the crab community structure. The crab community also changes with the age of the mangrove forest stand. Sesarmid crabs consistently dominated in mature forests, whereas young plantations were colonized mainly by ocypodid crabs. The findings show that heavily effected sites-e.g., disused tin mining areas, former concession forests, and abandoned shrimp ponds-can be rehabilitated by planting mangroves and that the crab community is a useful ecological indicator of habitat status.

AB  - Baseline ecological studies of pristine mangroves are important for monitoring, management and conservation of mangrove ecosystems. Diversity, density, biomass and community structure of crab and molluscan macrofauna were studied in a near-pristine mangrove forest in Sematan, Sarawak. In each of the nine 100-m(2) plots, six 15-min catching periods were used to collect crabs and three 1-m(2) quadrats were sampled for molluscan epifauna. Environmental variables and vegetation were also recorded in each 100-m(2) plot. Thirty-one crab species and 44 molluscan species were recorded, including a few species not previously reported from Sarawak. Crab community structure was correlated with topographical height and surface water pH and salinity. Gastropod community structure was correlated with redox potential of water at depth, topographical height, surface water pH and leaf litter. Crab community structure and species number were positively correlated with tree and seedling community structure and diversity, suggesting that the mangrove vegetation is important to the crab fauna as a habitat and food supply. Molluscan abundance was positively correlated with sapling diversity and negatively correlated with the numbers of mangrove associates and tree species. The young leaves on mangrove saplings may provide a better food source than those on mature trees or mangrove associates. The data from this study provide a valuable baseline for future use at this site and for comparison with more degraded mangrove habitats elsewhere in South-East Asia.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of continuous exposure to sublethal ammonia concentrations upon the characteristics of the locomotor activity rhythms in Uca princeps, exposed to artificial tides and light cycles. Adult male crabs were used for standardized 24 h ammonia acute toxicity tests. Sublethal ammonia concentrations were selected considering the results obtained in the acute bioassays as well as the unusual high ammonia concentrations registered in their natural habitat. Three independent groups of eight crabs each were exposed during 1520 days to 0.125, 3.5, and 18 mg N-TA/L in artificial sea water. Locomotor activity was recorded individually by means of infrared light crossings. Artificially created tidal and lightdark cycles were used along the experiments. The 24 h-LC50 was 186.02 mg N-TA/L. No mortality was registered in the crabs exposed to the sublethal ammonia concentrations. In control groups, organisms showed tidal activity onset mainly in low tide (ebb) and no response to light cycles while ammonia exposed crabs shifted their onset of activity to high tide, and a general increasing activity was observed along the experiment. The obtained results indicate that ammonia affects the entraining features of the tidal activity rhythm and demonstrate that under ammonia sublethal exposure, tides may present relative coordination with light cycles in the tidal activity rhythm of the crabs.

AB  - Animal communication theory predicts that low-frequency cheating should be common in generally honest signalling systems. However, perhaps because cheats are designed to go undetected, there are few examples of dishonest signals in natural populations. Here we present what we believe is the first example of a dishonest signal which is used commonly by males to attract mates and fight sexual rivals. After losing their large claw, male fiddler crabs (Uca annulipes) grow a new one which has less mass, is a less effective weapon and costs less to use in signalling than an equivalent-length claw of the original form. Males with original claws do not differentially fight males with regenerated claws even though they are likely to win. Regenerated claws effectively bluff fighting ability and deter potential opponents before they fight. During mate searching, females do not discriminate against males with low- mass, regenerated claws, indicating that they are deceived as to the true costs males pay to produce sexual signals. Up to 44% of males in natural populations have regenerated claws: a level unanticipated by current signalling theory. The apparent rarity of cheating may be an artefact of the usual difficulty of detecting cheats and dishonesty may be quite common.

AB  - In the fiddler crab, Uca annulipes, males attract receptive females into their burrows by waving their greatly enlarged major claw. We have previously shown that males clustered around a female wave in close synchrony. Females may have a preference for leading signals and synchronised waving may arise as an epiphenomenon of competition between males to signal first. Indeed, the males in clusters that females approach and visit in their burrows are more likely to produce leading waves than are their neighbours. Here we document two other differences in the waving behaviour of visited males and their neighbours. First, visited males complete the downward component of the wave more rapidly than their neighbours. Second, the interval between the end of one wave and the start of the next is shorter for visited males. How can waving be synchronous if visited males wave faster than their neighbours? While only 9% (40/431) of waves by neighbours did not overlap those of the visited male, 22% (110/501) of visited male waves did not overlap the wave of a focal neighbour (111 visited male-neighbour dyads). Hence, while overlapping waves are nearly synchronous, visited males produce additional, 'nonoverlapping' waves that result in a higher wave rate than that of their neighbours.

AB  - In the fiddler crab (Uca beebei) males build a small mud pillar next to their burrow which increases their attractiveness to females. Three hypotheses were tested to explain inter-male variation in pillar-building. (1) The benefits of pillar-building are density dependent. The experimental addition of vertical structures did not support this hypothesis as there was no change in the level of pillar-building. (2) There are two classes of males (pillar-builders and non-pillar-builders). This could either be due to an alternative mating strategy, or because pillar building is age or size-dependent. There was also no support for this hypothesis. (3) Pillar-building is an honest signal of male quality dependent on body condition. A food supplementation experiment was performed. Addition of food affected several aspects of male behaviour and resulted in a two fold increase in the number of pillars built between control and food treatments (P < 0.001). However, the percentage of males building pillars did not increase significantly. Pillar building in this species has been attributed to sensory exploitation. Our results indicate that a trait which may well have evolved through sensory exploitation also appears to be condition-dependent. We emphasise that showing that an ornament or behaviour is condition-dependent does not necessarily mean that it evolved through ''good gene'' processes. However, in terms of its current selective value, pillar building may be maintained through female choice because it acts as a signal of male condition.

AB  - In the fiddler crabs Uca saltitanta and Uca perplexa, males attract mates by waving their enlarged claws. We show that in both species waving is closely synchronised between neighbouring males in clusters, both in the presence of mate-searching females and in their absence. Wandering females visit those males in the cluster that produce more waves at faster wave rates. In U. perplexa, they also selectively visit those males that produce the greatest number of leading waves. Synchronous waving may be the result of a precedence effect causing male competition to produce leading signals.

AB  - Male fiddler crabs ( genus Uca) have an enlarged major claw that is used during fights. In most species, 50% of males have a major claw on the left and 50% on the right. In Uca vocans vomeris, however, less than 1.4% of males are left-clawed. Fights between opponents with claws on the same or opposite side result in different physical alignment of claws, which affects fighting tactics. Left-clawed males mainly fight opposite-clawed opponents, so we predicted that they would be better fighters due to their relatively greater experience in fighting opposite-clawed opponents. We found, however, that ( i) a left-clawed male retains a burrow for a significantly shorter period than a size-matched right-clawed male, ( ii) when experimentally displaced from their burrow, there is no difference in the tactics used by left-and right-clawed males to obtain a new burrow; however, right-clawed males are significantly more likely to initiate fights with resident males, and ( iii) right-clawed residents engage in significantly more fights than left-clawed residents. It appears that left-clawed males are actually less likely to fight, and when they do fight they are less likely to win, than right-clawed males. The low-level persistence of left-clawed males is therefore unlikely to involve a frequency-dependent advantage associated with fighting experience.

AB  - Accurate measurements of prey availability are vital to our understanding of foraging behaviour, particularly prey selectivity. In the present study, observations of shorebirds foraging for fiddler crabs on intertidal mudflats demonstrate that prey availability depends both on the temporal variation in crab activity and on the crabs' responses to the presence of foraging shorebirds. Our results suggest that measurements of prey availability that do not specifically account for prey activity patterns and their responses to predators are neccessarily inaccurate. Furthermore, our results also show that tests for foraging selectivity are extremely sensitive to the way in which prey availability is measured and can even indicate active prey selectivity when more accurate measures of prey availability show predators to be non-selective. Because inaccurate measures of food resources greatly reduce our ability to detect food preferences, greater care must be taken to account for prey activity patterns and their responses to predators in measurements of prey availability.

AB  - Active female sampling occurs in the fiddler crab Uca annullipes. Females sample the burrows of several males before remaining to mate in the burrow of the chosen partner. Females time larval release to coincide with the following nocturnal spring tide and must therefore leave sufficient time for embryonic development after mating. Here we show how this temporal constraint on search time affects female choosiness, We found that, at the start of the sampling period (when time constraints are minimal), females selectively sample the larger males in the population. Towards the end of the sampling period (when the temporal constraints increase the costs of sampling), females are less selective. Furthermore, we suggest that the number of males sampled (and other indices of ''sampling effort'') may not be reliable indicators of female choosiness and may not reflect the strength of female mating preferences under certain conditions. Burrow quality also emerged as an important criterion in final mate choice. Burrow structure potentially influences reproductive success, and mate acceptance based on burrow structure appears to involve a relatively invariant threshold criterion. Since there is no relationship between male size and burrow quality, females are using at least two independent criteria when choosing potential mates. We envisage mate choice as a two-stage process. First, females select which males to sample based on male size. They then decide whether or not to mate with a male based on burrow features. This sampling process explains how two unrelated variables can both predict male mating success.

AB  - Spontaneous alternation refers to the tendency of organisms to explore places that they have least recently visited. Our previous work showed that alternation performance of Carcinus maenas (invasive European green crab) was significantly higher than Callinectes sapidus (native blue crab), and chance level performance (Ramey, P. A., Teichman, E., Oleksiak, J., & Balci, F. [2009]. Spontaneous alternation in marine crabs: Invasive versus native species. Behavioural Processes, 82, 51-55.). In the current study, we first tested the robustness of these findings in the absence of visual cues, longer test durations, and wider maze dimensions. These manipulations enabled us to determine whether these two crab species relied on the visual cues provided during the spontaneous alternation task in our prior work, and allowed for better characterization of their exploratory activity in the maze. Our original findings were reproduced in the present study under these new task conditions, suggesting no role for visual cues during alternation, and emphasizing the robustness and generalizability of the corresponding interspecies differences in alternation performance. We also tested whether the lower alternation performance of C. sapidus also applied to another native crab species, Uca pugnax (fiddler crab). Spontaneous alternation performance of U. pugnax was significantly lower than C. maenas but indistinguishable from C. sapidus. Finally, we examined whether the potentially higher inherent risk-sensitivity of C. sapidus could have contributed to their lower alternation performance by testing C. maenas in the presence of a larger natural predator (stressor). Higher risk sensitivity presumably induced by the stressor led to locomotor activity patterns that better resembled those of C. sapidus, however the resultant reduction in alternation performance was not statistically significant.

AB  - Mud fiddler crabs, Uca pugnax, have a streak of blue coloration located on the front of the carapace above the mouth and centered between the eyes. We documented that this blue streak is absent in juveniles and develops as crabs become sexually mature. By photographing male crabs under controlled conditions in the laboratory, we demonstrated that the brightness of the blue streak (in comparison with the rest of the carapace) is dynamic, and can dim from bright blue to nearly black in fewer than two minutes. We examined blue streak variability in male crabs in response to physical factors (light and temperature) and social context to begin to understand what causes its dynamic response. The blue streak darkens in response to decreased ambient light, but does not respond to changes in temperature. In the field, it is brighter when crabs are roaming on the mudflat or fighting, but darker when crabs are basking or performing waving displays. The highly visual nature of fiddler crabs and the dynamic character of the blue streak suggest that it may communicate information about the state of a crab or its environment.

AB  - The island of Moorea, FP, lies at the node of a large amphidromic (Gr., running around) tidal system in the south central Pacific. Mean tidal range is less than 0.25 meters, and amplitude of the principal solar semidiurnal (12.0-h) tidal constituent, S2, exceeds that of the principal lunar semidiurnal (12.4-h) tidal constituent, M2. This means that high tides occur on a solar schedule (around noon and midnight) although the exact timing is modulated on a semi-monthly basis by the M2 constituent. Specimens of Uca tetragonon, which is active at low tide, were collected from a shallow tidal flat at Lake Temae and transported to Minnesota where they were placed in activity recorders under a light-dark schedule set to the times of sunrise and sunset at Moorea. Crabs exhibited strong daily rhythms with a major maximum in the afternoon (following the timing of the noon solar high tide in Moorea). The maximum was modulated in intensity on a semimonthly schedule corresponding to that of the tides, but the amplitude of the modulation was low and scarcely detected by periodogram analysis. Exposure of crabs to a 12.4-h artificial tide for eight weeks induced strong persistent tidal rhythms with periodogram peaks that equaled or exceeded the height of those of the daily rhythm. Comparable exposure of crabs to a 12.0-h tide resulted in a strictly daily pattern of activity with maxima following the noon and midnight high tides. Thus, specimens of U. tetragonon from a most unlikely tidal situation possess the capacity to time strong persistent lunar tidal rhythms and to adjust their strength to match the intensity of the M2 tidal constituent to which they are exposed.

AB  - Extracts prepared from the eyestalks of Uca pugilator were subjected to highvoltage vertical starch-gel electrophoresis to study the behavior of the melanindispersing fraction of the eyestalk extract in an electrical field. Separations were made in a pH range from 2.05 to 8.15 with McIlvaine buffer and at pH 8.9 with barbital buffer. During electrophoresis the apparatus was placed at about 3°C and an aluminum plate closely applied to the Saran-wrapped gel mold acted as a heat sink to dissipate the heat created in the gel. Over the range of hydrogen ion concentrations employed the biologically active fraction migrated as a single component. The isoelectric point appeared to be about pH 5.15. The hormonal activity migrated as much as 10 cm and responded in a manner predictable for an ampholyte to changes in voltage and pH. The assay procedure resolved the width of the active band within 1 or 2 cm of gel.

AB  - A number of studies have suggested that mangrove forests and their faunal components may be pre-adapted to the impact of organic waste discharge, making them possible natural wastewater treatment wetlands. However, the results from recent research are contradictory. Some studies have shown that negative effects, sometimes subtle and difficult to observe, can be detected on specific biotic components of forests subjected to organic pollution. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate possible alterations in the ecosystem engineering activities of a fiddler crab community dominating the landward belts of Kenyan mangrove forests. The total processed sediment produced by burrowing and foraging activities in a population from a pen-urban mangrove area receiving untreated domestic sewage was compared with that from a forest not affected by urban wastewater. The results showed how the pert-urban site hosted a higher biomass of crabs, which produced a significantly lower amount of processed sediment compared with the pristine site, resulting in a lower total top sediment mixing activity of the crabs. Thus, the present study showed a link between sewage exposure and top sediment reworking by crabs, which is potentially beneficial for mangrove growth and ecosystem functioning. This represents a possible example of cryptic ecological degradation in mangal systems. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The study aimed at investigating the effects of sewage loadings on the behaviour of two fiddler crabs species maintained in a system of experimental mesocosms, built in a mangrove area in Tanzania and inundated with different seawater/sewage mixtures. Our results show that sewage loads led to a modification of the overall activity budget of the crab community as a result of increased hypertrophic conditions (high COD, increased chlorophyll-a concentrations). During their activity period, crabs inside contaminated mesocosms seemed to satisfy their feeding demand faster than those of the control cells, spending a significant longer time in other activities like courtship and territorial defence. Apart from being a good biological indication of ecosystem eutrophication, such a reduced foraging activity by fiddler crabs also depresses their sediment bioturbation activity, important factor for the health of mangrove systems, suggesting practical implications regarding the efficiency of mangrove-based wetlands for treatment of domestic sewage.

AB  - This study was conducted in the Itacuruca mangrove, in the Sepetiba Bay, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, with the objective of investigating the population structure of the species of Uca Leach, 1814. Sampling was carried out monthly from June, 2005 to May, 2006, during low tides. Crabs were captured manually by two people for a period of 15 min each. A total of 2580 crabs were obtained, of which 1465 were males and 1115 were females. The size of the fiddler crabs in the mangrove of Itacuruca were the smallest reported so far in Brazilian mangroves. However, males attained a larger size than females. The size frequency distribution was unimodal for most of species, with the exception of U. thayeri Rathbun,1900 and U. vocator (Herbst, 1804), which did not show a clearly-defined pattern. Males were most abundant among the largest size classes. The sex ratio differed significantly from 1:1 (male: female), most often with a higher frequency of males, except for U. thayeri and U. victoriana von Hagen, 1987, in which females were predominant.

AB  - Uca pugnax and U. pugilator are common fiddler crabs in salt marshes on the Atlantic coast of the United States. As adults, U. pugnax frequent muddier, vegetated (typically Spartina alterniflora) substrate while U. pugilator usually occupy sandier, open habitats. It is unclear where juvenile U. pugnax and U. pugilator reside because the early crab stages of these species are difficult to identify by simple gross morphology. Using a novel restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) protocol to distinguish postlarval U. pugnax and U. pugilator, we studied their distribution along a horizontal gradient in the North Inlet Estuary, South Carolina. We collected juvenile crabs along transects at 3 different sites that spanned S. alterniflora-covered mud and open sand habitats with adult populations of U. pugnax and U. pugilator, respectively. Over 75% of the juveniles collected were U. pugnax, showing greater recruitment by this species. U. pugnax juveniles of all sizes preferred the same muddy habitat occupied by adults, but habitat preferences of juvenile U. pugilator varied by site. Generally, U. pugilator displayed a shift in distribution from S. alterniflora cover to sandier habitat during early juvenile stages. The younger stages may prefer S. alterniflora-covered, muddier habitat because it provides better cover from predators, or so that they can avoid displacement by currents during high tides; alternatively, they may be able to feed better on muddy sediment. U. pugilator develops specialized mouthparts to scrape organic matter from larger sand grains, but these are not present in early juveniles nor in U. pugnax juveniles. Although young juvenile U. pugnax strongly favored S. alterniflora cover, older juveniles (those large enough to dig burrows for protection) were occasionally found in sandier habitat with U. pugilator.

AB  - The relative growth of the fiddler crab Uca burgersi Holthuis, 1967 was analyzed in two populations from different mangroves (Ubatumirim and Cavalo rivers) in the southeastern Brazilian coast, monthly sampled from May, 2001 to April, 2002. The population from a high productivity level mangrove reaches the sexual maturity in larger sizes than the population from a less productive site. This results can be attributed to the greater amount of nutrients found in the Cavalo than in Ubatumirim mangrove.

AB  - Population and reproductive biology were studied in three populations of the crab Uca burgersi Holthuis, 1967, in the Indaia, Cavalo and Ubatumirim mangrove forests (Ubatuba, Sao Paulo State, Brazil). Crabs were collected during low tide (August 2001 through July 2002), by digging the sediment, with a standard capture effort (two persons for 30 min.). Carapace width was measured, and gonad developmental stage was recorded from all specimens. U. burgersi was most abundant in the Cavalo mangrove, where the largest mate was found. Juvenile crabs were found year-round at all three sites. However, the ratio of ovigerous females was very low, even null in the Cavalo mangrove. The gonad development rate indicated that U. burgersi was reproducing continuously, but more intensively during spring and summer, with recruitment occurring in winter. The synchrony between the populational and reproductive biology in the three areas showed that local features were not the limiting factors. It is suggested that this species is a habitat generalist.

AB  - Morphological aspects of spermatozoa in marine animals have been used in recent decades as phylogenetic criteria (spermiotaxonomy). This paper presents ultrastructural descriptions of the spermatozoa from Uca maracoani, U. thayeri, and U. vocator. A small portion of the vas deferens of each species was examined under the transmission and scanning electron microscopy. The ultrastructural analysis showed that each spermatophore consists of a varying number of spermatozoa embedded in a dense fibrillar matrix surrounded by a membrane. The spermatozoa of U. maracoani, U. thayeri, and U. vocator are typical of brachyurans. The Voluminous acrosome is characterized by three different layers. The postero-lateral surface of the acrosome is cupped by the reduced cytoplasm, and the anterior surface is covered by the operculum. The perforatorium consists of coiled, helicoidal membranous tubules and is continuous with the cytoplasm. The nucleus is composed by uncondensed chromatin and presents several lateral arms distributed over the entire equatorial plane of the cell. The presence of the apical button is a well defined character among all species of the genus Uca, but in U. thayeri it was not observed. The accessory opercular ring can be found in the three studied species, but in distinct development degree-Two centrioles were detected in U. thayeri and U. vocator, but only one was found in U. maracoani. The presence of centrioles in the mature spermatozoa is the first account for the genus Uca upto-date. Considering the ultrastructure of the spermatozoa of U. maracoani, U. thayeri, and U. vocator, we suggest that these three species partially follow the morphological patterns previously described in other Thoracotremata brachyurans. The absence of the apical button in U. thayeri spermatozoa may represent an evolutionary novelty in the genus Uca. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The ultrastructure of the sperm of the gecarcinid land crab Cardisoma guanhumi is described by scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Ultrastructural sperm morphology lends support for the monophyletic origin of the Thoracotremata, and for the placement of C. guanhumi in that clade. Additionally, it further attests the low level of variability within the thoracotreme clade. With regard to ultrastructural morphology, small differences concerning the apical button, the hyaline periopercular rim, the inner acrosome zone, and the outer two lamellations in the outer acrosome zone have been found between the spermatozoa of C. guanhumi and Cardisoma carnifex, the only other species in this genus studied for spermatozoal morphology.

AB  - Fiddler crabs demonstrate a wide range of simple and complex behaviors in both mating strategies and defense mechanisms. During investigation, five species of fiddler crabs were observed engaging in immobility or catatonic behaviors after being turned upside down. While crabs were observed in a rigid, immobile posture for mean ranges of 45-171 seconds, several crabs were recorded to remain immobile for more than two hours. Fiddler crabs are often preyed upon by birds that use crab movement as a cue. Other crustacean species, such as lobsters, have been observed in this upside-down, immobile position after having their abdomens rubbed. Consequently, immobility may be an anti-predator strategy when escape is not feasible or a byproduct of tactile stimulation.

AB  - The constant addition of anthropogenic pollutants into estuarine waters has elicited a concern for organisms within this complex habitat. Fiddler crabs, Uca pugnax, were collected from several sites along the New Jersey Coast to determine if and how environments with varying levels of pollutants might impact aspects of behavioral ecology, metal storage and depuration, and population biology. Behavioral observations revealed no aberrant behaviors in crabs from a highly contaminated site. However, at the most contaminated site decreased foraging time and more time spent in burrows, possibly related to higher nutrients, was found. Activity was also affected by weather. Developing a tolerance combined with the nutrient rich environment may enable this species to thrive in contaminated marsh ecosystems. Metal distributions in the exoskeleton and soft tissues during intermolt and immediate post-molt revealed that crabs from the highly contaminated site had significantly higher concentrations and they depurated a significant amount of lead and mercury. The proportions (soft tissues/exoskeleton) vary with metal type and changes between intermolt and molt phases. Crabs from the cleaner site shifted all metal types into the soft tissue prior to molting. In contrast, crabs from the contaminated site shifted non-essential elements (Cd, Pb, Hg) into their exoskeleton prior to molting. However, molting reduced overall body burdens significantly and is a feasible mechanism to depurate non-essential metals in both populations. Investigation of population parameters showed that crabs from the highly contaminated site were significantly larger in size, but had lower population density, lower recruitment, shorter reproductive season and lower survivorship of early benthic phases. This study also determined that the reproductive season for Uca pugnax in New Jersey is longer than previously reported and may reflect of climate changes. This study suggests that fiddler crab population density may be reduced due to contamination. However, tolerance may develop through mechanisms such as depurating toxicants via molting. Consequently, the usefulness (or sensitivity) of behavioral observations to assess the effect of contaminants may be limited once mechanisms have developed to compensate for toxicants.

AB  - Metal distributions in the exoskeleton and soft tissues of the fiddler crab, Uca pugnax, were examined during intermolt and immediate postmolt to determine if distribution of the metals changed prior to molting and to determine if molting is a feasible mechanism to depurate metals. Fiddler crabs were collected from two locations in New Jersey, a highly contaminated site and a relatively clean environment. The crabs from the contaminated site had higher concentrations of metals in their soft tissues for Cu, significantly higher concentrations of Pb in their soft tissues and carapace, but did not have any significant differences in concentrations of Zn in comparison to their conspecifics from the relatively clean site during intermolt. Crabs from the contaminated site has significantly higher levels of Cu, Pb, and Zn in both their soft tissues and exuvia immediately after molting. Crabs from both sites shifted copper and zinc from the carapace into the soft tissues prior to molting. Lead distribution shifted from the soft tissues to the exoskeleton prior to molting in the population from the contaminated site but shifted from the exoskeleton into the soft tissues for the relatively clean site. Average percent of the total body burden eliminated during the molting process for the highly contaminated site varied with each metal, 12% Cu, 76% Pb, and 22% Zn. Average percent of the total body burden eliminated during molting process for the relatively clean site also varied with each metal and was significantly lower than the conspecifics from the contaminated site, 3% Cu, 56% Ph, and 8% Zn. Molting can reduce overall body burdens significantly and is a feasible mechanism to depurate lead. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Fiddler crabs, Uca pugnax, were collected from a highly contaminated site and a relatively clean site, both in New Jersey to determine if and how environments with varying levels of pollutants may impact aspects of population biology including individual size, morphology (major cheliped size), population density, fecundity, recruitment and survivorship of early benthic phases. Crabs from the highly contaminated site were significantly larger in size, but had lower population density, lower recruitment, reduced reproductive season and lower survivorship of early benthic phases. Our study suggests that contamination may play a role in population ecology of U. pugnax. This study also determined that the reproductive season for U. pugnax in New Jersey is much longer than reported in the literature and could potentially be impacted by global climate change.

AB  - Secondary sexual characters in many species function both in male-male competition and as cues for female choice. Based on a literature compilation of existing knowledge of traits with this dual function, we propose that they commonly arise through intrasexual selection processes and serve as honest signals to other males regarding fighting ability or dominance. Faking these traits, here called armaments, (i.e. weapons and status badges) is difficult, as they are constantly put to trial in male-male contests. Females that subsequently utilize them as indicators of male phenotypic quality when selecting a partner will benefit by acquiring males of higher quality to father their offspring. Thus, evolution of armaments through male-male competition is seen as a usually initiating process, whereas female choice later may assume a role as an additional selective factor. The reverse, that males use information from traits evolved through female choice, is, however, also possible. The traditional view of independently evolved and temporarily unordered intra- and intersexual selection processes fails to explain dual trait functions. Moreover, our model may more satisfyingly than traditional ones explain how trait honesty and trait genetic variance are maintained: theoretical and empirical evidence suggests that such honesty and variation are more easily maintained under male-male competition than under female choice.

AB  - Understanding the interactions between macrofauna organisms and sediment biogeochemistry and microbioloy is crucial in evaluating marine ecosystem functioning. Most of the seafloor is influenced by bioturbation, yet macrofaunal activity and its influences on biogeochemical processes are not well studied. The goal of the presented research was to combine innovative approaches and modern techniques to investigate the interactions of geochemical processes, microbial activities, and macrofauna assemblages in two marine habitats: coastal sediments and deep-sea methane seeps. A coastal lagoon in Catalina Harbor, CA, was characterized by dense populations of the ghost shrimp Neotrypaea californiensis and the fiddler crab Uca crenulata. The shrimp lived permanently subsurface and maintained complex deep-reaching burrows that it ventilated constantly. The crab built shallow simple burrows, mainly for protection, and often left the burrow to forage. Differences in burrowing behavior were reflected in contrasting microbial diversities. Shrimp burrow microbial communities were similar to those found in surface sediments while crab burrow communities were not significantly different from subsurface sediment communities. Next, specific microbial activities were examined surrounding N. californiensis burrows. High levels of sulfate reduction (SR), along with nitrogen fixation, were found in and around the burrows, supporting the idea that bioturbation can lead to the formation of reduced microniches characterized by elevated microbial activities. 2-dimensional mapping of these microniches showed that sulfate reduction rates (SRR) in reduced microniches associated with burrows were 3 orders of magnitude higher than the surrounding sediment. At western North American methane seeps, the seepage of methane-laden fluids supports sulfide-oxidizing microbial mats and rich communities of vesicomyid clams ( Calyptogena ) harboring sulfide-oxidizing symbionts. It is assumed that the sulfide supporting these communities is produced by the coupled reaction of SR and anaerobic oxidation of methane. Yet, it is relatively unknown what influence the clams have on benthic geochemical gradients and microbial processes. Three seep locations (Hydrate Ridge, Eel River, and Monterey Bay) were examined for the influence of clams on local biogeochemical processes. In all cases, the clams significantly increased SRR. Microsensor measurements indicated that the clams transported sulfate-rich overlying water deeper into the sediment where it could be used for microbial SR.

AB  - We used a combination of field and laboratory approaches to address how the bioturbation activity of two crustaceans, the ghost shrimp Neotrypaea californiensis and the fiddler crab Uca crenulata, affects the microbial diversity in the seabed of a coastal lagoon (Catalina Harbor, Santa Catalina Island, CA, USA). Detailed geochemical analyses, including oxygen microsensor measurements, were performed to characterize environmental parameters. We used a whole-assemblage fingerprinting approach (ARISA: amplified ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis) to compare bacterial diversity along geochemical gradients and in relation to subsurface microniches. The two crustaceans have different burrowing behaviors. The ghost shrimp maintains complex, deep-reaching burrows and permanently lives subterranean, supplying its burrow with oxygen- rich water. In contrast, the fiddler crab constructs simpler, J-shaped burrows, which it does not inhabit permanently and does not actively ventilate. Our goal was to address how varying environmental parameters affect benthic microbial communities. An important question in benthic microbial ecology has been whether burrows support similar or unique communities compared with the sediment surface. Our results showed that sediment surface microbial communities are distinct from subsurface assemblages and that different burrow types support diverse bacterial taxa. Statistical comparisons by canonical correspondence analysis indicated that the availability of oxidants (oxygen, nitrate, ferric iron) play a key role in determining the presence and abundance of different taxa. When geochemical parameters were alike, microbial communities associated with burrows showed significant similarity to sediment surface communities. Our study provides implications on the community structure of microbial communities in marine sediments and the factors controlling their distribution.

AB  - The fiddler crabs Uca panacea Novak & Salmon, 1974 and Uca pugilator (Bosc, 1802) are closely related North American species that are sympatric along the north coast of Gulf of Mexico. Since U. panacea was described, there has been confusion in the identification these two species. Morphological differences between these two fiddlers have been pointed out in recent years, mainly regarding the presence of a pigment spot and granulations on the dorsal margin of carapace in U. pugilator. We report herein some intraspecific differences between the two species that we believe to be useful in avoiding misidentification among preserved specimens of these two fiddler crabs, such as the absence of the pigment spot in U. pugilator and the presence of the pigment spot and granulations on dorsal margin of carapace in U. panacea as well. Our results have also revealed that 65% of the U. pugilator specimens examined possess a gape pile in the major chela, which is not a reliable diagnostic character, but could be useful when present. The gonopods of both species were analyzed using SEM, confirming the previous statement that the sub-terminal thumb is shorter in U. panacea than in U. pugilator. Finally, as important morphological characters are missing in the original description of U. panacea, a redescription of this species is also provided.

AB  - Population and reproductive biology of Uca thayeri Rathbun, 1900 were studied for the first time in a tropical mangrove. Absolute density, sex ratio, population structure, handedness, breeding season and fecundity were investigated. Seven transects were delimited in a mangrove area of the Pacoti River, Northeast of Brazil (3 degrees 43' 02" S/38 degrees 32' 35" W). On each transect, ten 0.25 M-2 squares were sampled on a monthly basis during low tide periods from September 2003 to August 2004. A total of 483 crabs were obtained, of which 250 were males, 219 non-ovigerous females, and 14 ovigerous females. The U. thayeri population presented bi-modal size frequency distribution, with males and non-ovigerous females not differing significantly size-wise. Ovigerous females were larger than males and non-ovigerous females. The overall sex ratio (1:1.07) did not differ significantly from the expected 1:1 proportion. The major cheliped was the right one in 50% of the males. The observed density was of 8.5 individuals/M-2, with the specimens being found mostly in shaded areas. Ovigerous females were found in 5 months of the year, coinciding with the rainy season, suggesting that the population of U. thayeri presents seasonal reproductive events. juvenile crabs were more abundant during the dry period, while larger crabs were found mainly during the rainy period. The fecundity of the studied population was much smaller than that of subtropical populations of this species. The regression analysis shows that the number of eggs increases linearly with the increase of carapace width. (C) 2007 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB  - The predatory behaviour of seven captive white ibises, Eudocimus albus, on sand fiddler crabs, Uca pugilator, was studied to assess the degree to which the enlarged claw of male crabs affects the relative vulnerabilities of male versus female crabs. When given a simultaneous choice between a female and male crab or between a male crab with its major claw removed and an intact male, all seven ibises showed a preference for the animal without the major claw. Overall, when offered crabs on an exposed surface, ibises chose female and declawed male crabs four times as often as intact male crabs. When probing into artificial burrows containing either a male or female crab, all seven ibises rejected male crabs almost twice as often as they did female crabs. During encounters both with crabs on the surface and with crabs in burrows, ibises appeared to be especially wary of the enlarged claw of male crabs. These data suggest that sexual dimorphism in sand fiddler crabs substantially affects the relative vulnerabilities of male and female crabs to avian predators.

AB  - Animals navigate over a range of distances, but it has been the global navigation of species migrating among spatially restricted, seasonal homes separated by thousands of kilometers that continues to defy a thorough mechanistic explanation. We survey the navigational behavior of migratory salmon, whales, sea turtles, and birds, as well as dispersing monarch butterflies, to promote the idea that an explicitly comparative approach to global navigation can provide insight into the evolution and properties of navigational mechanisms. The navigational abilities of migrant birds and sea turtles are used to illustrate the concepts of true navigation and vector navigation, leading us to consider the selective forces that might shape the evolution of navigational mechanisms. We propose that different navigational mechanisms, with different scales of accuracy, are likely employed during the course of migration. Furthermore, superficially similar global migratory behavior in different taxonomic groups is likely characterized by different sensory, representational and neural mechanisms reflective of group-specific adaptation to the physical properties of a migratory environment.

AB  - On the 25 April 1998, the giant holding pool of the Aznalcollar mine, owned by the Canadian-Swedish Company Boliden Ltd burst its banks; 5 million cubic meters (6.7 million cubic yards) of sludge poured into the nearby River Guadiamar, which is a tributary of the River Guadalquivir (the main river of the south Iberian Peninsula). Within hours of the accident, approximately 2.5 Hm(3) of acidic water with high concentrations of metals, especially Zn, had entered the River Guadalquivir. A biomonitoring program has been carried out to evaluate the incidence of this spill on the fauna of the River Guadalquivir. Six sampling stations within the estuary of were established and six species of molluscs (Crassostrea angulata, Scrobicularia plana), crustaceans (Palameon longirostris, Uca tangeri, Melicertus kerathurus) and fish (Liza ramada) were chosen for analysis. In the Portuguese oyster, Crassostrea angulata, Cd and Cu concentrations were above the maximum allowed by the Spanish legislation for bivalves for human consumption (60 mu g.g(-1) wet wt. for Cu and 1.0 mu g.g(-1) wet wt. for Cd). The crustaceans Palaemon longirostris and Uca tangeri, also showed values above the legal limits for Cu (20 mu g.g(-1) wet wt.). An increase of the Zn levels was observed, as Zn concentrations in C. angulata were higher than those reported 30 years ago. The heavy metal concentrations in some of the organisms collected in the River Guadalquivir were higher than in the Bay of Cadiz or the Mediterranean Sea (clean sites), showing that this estuary was subjected to a heavy metal load. One month after the accident, concentrations of Zn were higher in C. angulata and in Palaemon longirostris compared with levels recorded on the 25 April. Nevertheless, some organisms did not show a clear tendency during the sampling period, probably due to the fluctuations of environmental (salinity, temperature) and physiological variables that affect bioaccumulation.

AB  - The SW Atlantic fiddler crab Uca uruguayensis (Nobili 1901) is distributed from the northern limit of the Argentinean Biogeographic Province (31 degreesS to 42 degreesS) to the northern part of Argentina (38 degrees 34'S), This distribution range seem puzzling given that this biogeographic province goes several hundred kilometers S and there are no obvious environmental discontinuities that might explain this pattern. To explore possible causes of this distribution, hypotheses related to biological and oceanographic constraints were investigated. A comparative study between the three southern sites (Bahia Samborombon, 35 degrees 30'-36 degrees 22'S; Mar Chiquita coastal lagoon, 37 degrees 46'S and Quequen Grande river, 38 degrees 34'S) where this species inhabits showed that biological constraints are not the limiting factor. There were no differences in morphometry, reproductive timing and output, body condition and larval sizes. Differences were only found on the size frequency distributions, which indicate differences in recruitment regularity. However, wind patterns relative to coastal bearings indicate that during the period of larval release and recruitment (December to April), the contribution of wind drift transport are less frequently coastward from the La Plata river (35 degrees -36 degrees 20'S, where Samborombon is located) to the south. If the wind stress is the main force moving the upper layer of the water column and consequently crab larvae, then this pattern would indicate that there is a decrease in the chances of carrying megalopae to the coast south of the La Plata river. On the basis of this information we suggest that the southern distribution limits of this species is mainly due to wind pattern.

AB  - Large male fiddler crabs sometimes help smaller neighbours to defend their territories against intruders. These coalitions occur when the helper is likely to defeat the intruder (helper larger than intruder) and the neighbour is likely to lose his territory without help (intruder larger than neighbour). Previous studies of coalitions have excluded males with regenerated claws. Such claws are weaker weapons that make the bearer competitively inferior. Here, we show that male Uca annulipes with regenerated claws are as likely as males with original claws to help their neighbours in territory defence, even though, as weaker males they potentially pay greater costs, being more likely to lose their undefended burrow. We suggest that males with regenerated claws gain greater benefits from retaining a current, small neighbour and that, as in non-coalition fights, the regenerated claw acts as a visual bluff in the early stages of combat. Furthermore, we show that intruders with regenerated or original claws are equally likely to be attacked by a 'helping' neighbour. This bolsters the argument that males cannot visually differentiate between original and regenerated claws.

AB  - Females often have strong preferences for the most attractive males that provide the greatest benefits. However, searching for and sampling potential mates is costly. Females are therefore expected to make an optimizing choice whereby the benefits provided by the male outweigh the cost of choosing him. Consequently males should benefit by minimizing costs experienced by sampling females, or by reducing the ability of females to assess these costs. We investigated the economics of female mate choice in the fiddler crab Uca mjoebergi through observation of natural mate-searching behaviour, and by manipulating the costs of choice in a series of two-choice experiments using robotic crabs. Observed females were choosy about their mates, but this selectivity declined when predation risk increased. Experimental females were allowed to choose between males of different attractiveness at a range of distances from the female, with the more attractive male placed further from the female. Females did not travel further to reach a more attractive male except when distances were small. These results suggest that greater attractiveness does not always ensure greater mating success for males, as distant males experience a disadvantage. Male mate-attracting behaviour was then investigated, as male U. mjoebergi often leave their territories to approach sampling females, behaviour that may overcome a distance disadvantage. Males closely approached females regardless of their distance from the female. This behaviour is likely to prevent females from making the optimal choice, as they cannot include travel costs in their assessment of males.

AB  - Cooperation between neighbors in territory defense is expected when the cost of helping a neighbor is less than that of establishing new boundaries with a successful usurper of a neighboring territory. Cooperation has been documented in 3 species of fiddler crab and is understood to depend strongly on the relative sizes of participants-large residents will help smaller neighbors repel intermediate-sized intruders. Simply meeting these criteria does not, however, guarantee that helping occurs, and additional factors are likely to affect the benefits of providing help. We tested whether the likelihood that a large resident would help his smaller neighbor was affected by neighbor familiarity or the relative size of the smaller neighbor, by replacing neighbors with smaller, larger, or size-matched individuals and then simulating intrusions onto their territories. The likelihood of helping did not differ between familiar and unfamiliar neighbors of the same size, but it decreased when the replacement resident differed in size from the original resident. These results suggest that although residents do not recognize their neighbors individually, size acts as a cue to neighbor identity.

AB  - Theory predicts that territory owners will help established neighbours to repel intruders, when doing so is less costly than renegotiating boundaries with successful usurpers of neighbouring territories. Here, we show for the first time, to our knowledge, cooperative territory defence between heterospecific male neighbours in the fiddler crabs Uca elegans and Uca mjoebergi. We show experimentally that resident U. elegans were equally likely to help a smaller U. mjoebergi or U. elegans neighbour during simulated intrusions by intermediate sized U. elegans males (50% of cases for both). Helping was, however, significantly less likely to occur when the intruder was a U. mjoebergi male (only 15% of cases).

AB  - Territory owners often respond with greater aggression to strangers than to neighbouring individuals, a phenomenon known as the 'dear enemy' effect. As strangers are usually 'floating' individuals seeking to acquire a territory they pose a relatively greater threat to a resident than do neighbours, who are already territory owners. This explains why residents are less aggressive towards neighbours but not how they distinguish neighbours from strangers: do residents recognize their neighbours or respond to differences in the behaviour of neighbours and strangers? Using measures of fighting intensity we investigated the dear enemy effect in a fiddler crab, Uca mjoebergi. We then experimentally manipulated the residency status of pairs of neighbours to distinguish between mechanisms enabling the dear enemy response. Fights between resident and nonterritory-owning individuals were longer and more escalated than fights between neighbouring residents, whether the nonterritory-owner was familiar (a former neighbour) or unfamiliar to the resident. Our results are consistent with the 'relative threat' hypothesis to explain the dear enemy effect, and support the suggestion that residents use cues in the behaviour of an intruder to determine the level of threat posed and distinguish between neighbours and strangers. However, we note that the observed patterns can occur even if residents do not differentiate between intruder types, and simply respond appropriately to the aggressiveness and persistence of an intruder.

AB  - Mate choice is potentially beneficial whenever prospective mates vary in quality, but when mates are encountered sequentially the cost of rejecting a current mating opportunity affects the net benefit of choosiness by lowering the mating rate. There is, however, no reduction in mating rate when choosing among potential mates that are encountered simultaneously. In general, mating with a heterospecific is costly as the resultant offspring are of low fitness. It is often argued that males, unlike females, will court and even mate with heterospecifics because the lost opportunity cost is minimal if they rarely encounter potential mates. In the fiddler crab Uca mjoebergi, we show that, in a natural situation, where females arrived sequentially males were equally likely to court conspecifics and heterospecifics. Females were released individually into the population, and nearly every male they passed performed a courtship waving display whether the female was conspecific or heterospecific. Taken alone, this result implies that males exhibit no species discrimination. However, in an experimental setting where males simultaneously viewed a conspecific and a heterospecific female, males waved faster and for longer at conspecific females, and attempted to mate more often with conspecifics. This indicates that U. mjoebergi males can discriminate between conspecific and heterospecific females and prefer to court conspecifics when given a choice. We used mate choice among rather than within species (to maximize variation in mate quality) to illustrate the need to distinguish between simultaneous and sequential mate choice when quantifying mating preferences.

AB  - Mimicry of females enables weaker males in many species to avoid intrasexual aggression. In fiddler crabs (Uca annulipes), males use their major claw in aggressive interactions to acquire and defend a territory. Males that have autotomised their major claw will be disadvantaged in fighting, but might use their temporary resemblance to females to avoid costly aggressive encounters with other males. We investigated whether: (1) courting males mistake clawless male fiddler crabs for females; (2) clawless males are able to acquire, defend and retain territories as successfully as intact males; and (3) clawless males are more cautious than intact males. Clawless and intact males differed in burrow acquisition methods and fighting behaviour, but were equally successful at acquiring and retaining burrows. While courting males treated clawless males as female, we found no evidence that clawless males mimic the behaviour of females, or that they exploit the advantage of their mistaken identity. Clawless males further appear to avoid male aggression by altering their territorial strategies to minimise the potential for conflict.

AB  - Many estuarine species with relatively immobile adult life histories have pelagic larval life stages that increase their dispersal capabilities. Limitations to the successful recruitment of postlarvae and juveniles back to conspecific adult habitats is dependant on the physiological and developmental constraints on the larvae, biotic interactions (i.e. predation, prey availability, competition), cue recognition and response and physical factors (i.e. physiography of the estuary, tidal amplitude, river discharge, salinity, density gradients, wind). We developed an empirical one-dimensional flow model for the freshwater, tidal portion of the Pee Dee River that discharges into Winyah Bay, South Carolina. I chose Uca minax as our model organism due to its ability to successfully inhabit brackish and freshwater habitats throughout Winyah Bay and its confluent tidal rivers. The coupled larval behavior-transport model is capable of predicting U. minax dispersal in the tidal freshwater reaches of the Pee Dee River for any combination of river discharge and tidal amplitude. I have recently begun to calibrate and ground-truth the model. In the model, I assume that larvae and postlarvae behave as passive particles in the horizontal direction, but have the ability to move vertically in the water column. I have confirmed that megalopae of U. minax migrate toward the surface in response to flood currents and sink during ebb currents. Mean densities of U. minax burrows in the Pee Dee River were recorded along a longitudinal river transect and compared favorably with model predictions of expected rates of megalopae settlement. Metamorphosis and survivorship studies were conducted with U. minax megalopae to develop metamorphosis/survivorship function for the model. The results of these studies will be used to calibrate and validate our coupled larval behavior-transport model.

AB  - Long-term and short-term human disturbances of river hydrology can significantly affect net flow into estuaries such as in Winyah Bay near Georgetown, South Carolina. The effects of changing river flow will have an impact on the recruitment of Uca minax postlarvae (megalopae) to freshwater upriver areas where they settle into adult habitats and metamorphose. Brachyuran megalopae have been shown to utilize flood-tide transport (FTT) to migrate to nursery areas upstream where cover and potential food sources are plentiful. The FTT model adequately explains recruitment of megalopae in well-mixed, tidally-dominated estuaries. In these estuaries the difference in duration and intensity of ebb tidal and flood tidal currents is not significant. However, applying the FTT model may be problematic in narrow, river-dominated estuaries that have significant net downstream flow, such as Winyah Bay. We developed an empirical two-dimensional flow model for the freshwater, tidal portion of the Great Pee Dee River that discharges into Winyah Bay. Our model is predictive of potential human-induced changes in flow (from increased upriver water usage) or eustatic sea level rise (due to affects of global warming) that will amplify the intensity and duration of flood tidal currents that transport marine larvae upstream. The flow model we developed can be used to assess the potential impacts of changing river flow and sea level on larval recruitment and dispersal of many types of planktonic larvae to upstream areas of coastal rivers. The model may also be used by scientists, resource managers and stakeholders when making decisions about minimum river flow allocations.

AB  - The bioenergetic cost of osmotic stress is often expressed in reduction of energy reserves available for growth and reproduction. Large populations of red-jointed fiddler crab, Uca minax (LeConte, 1855) have been observed all along the Winyah Bay estuary in South Carolina. Upriver populations live their entire juvenile and adult lives in freshwater and are able to reproduce successfully reproduce even with the presumed increase in energy expenditure required for osmoregulation. In order to assess the possible bioenergetic cost of occupying upriver freshwater habitats versus brackish water habitats, we examined both size and fecundity in crabs from upriver and downriver populations. Ovigerous U. minax females were collected from two sites on three occasions shortly before peak nocturnal spring tides when hatching of zoea larvae typically occurs. Size and fecundity were examined by measuring adult female dimensions, brood size and zoeal lipid content. Based on preliminary data female carapace width, and width/length ratios were found to be statistically different between the two locations, with the upriver population containing larger, boxier crabs. Brood size and individual zoeae dry weight differences were not found to not be significantly different between the two populations. Size differences between the populations remained consistent even when the investigation was expanded to include both males and females. Qualitative and quantitative results of zoeal essential lipid content were also examined by GC/MS analysis of fatty acid methyl esters in order to determine if females of the two populations provisioned their offspring differently.

AB  - In river-dominated estuaries such as Winyah Bay at the base of the Pee Dee River in South Carolina, USA, the net movement of water and pelagic larvae is toward the ocean. Larvae of many decapods are hypothesized to recruit back into estuaries using a complex behavior termed flood-tide transport (FTT). A pattern of late-stage larval behaviors in concert with daily tidal rhythms yields net larval transport upstream into the estuary. Tidal currents in narrow river channels exhibit little distortion of flow, resulting in near linear flows. This means that there is a linear decay in tidal current amplitude over the last few kilometers of the upper estuary that can be easily modeled with a simple 1-dimensional (1D) model. With our 1D model, we demonstrate that ebb and flood currents can be modeled accurately near the limit of maximum upstream tidal influence within narrow river-dominated estuaries. Our model predicts the damping of flood tidal current in the face of river discharge. This dampening restricts the upriver migration potential of larvae that use FTT to return to adult habitats, or colonize new habitat. When our model is coupled with FTT behavior, we can predict the ability of red-jointed fiddler crab Uca minax (LeConte 1855) larvae to recruit back to the freshwater reaches of the Pee Dee River estuary for any combination of river discharges or tidal amplitudes. The flow model we developed can be used to assess the potential impacts of changing river flow and sea level on larval recruitment to upstream areas of coastal rivers.

AB  - Distribution of juvenile fiddler crabs (Uca spp.) is thought to be determined by physical and biotic stimuli present during the reinvasion of the estuary by megalopae from off-shore environments. The interaction of behavior, development, physiological tolerance and physical factors results in dispersal and eventual settlement of megalopae in various habitats within the estuary. Our laboratory developed and groundtruthed a larval transport model to predict how these processes influence dispersal of Uca minax within the Winyah Bay estuary and its confluent rivers (Georgetown, SC). We focused on the effects of temperature as well as the relationship between putative cues from natural sediment and water from various locations in the river that may affect the timing of metamorphosis and survivorship of megalopae. U. minax megalopae were collected from freshwater reaches of the Waccamaw River, up-estuary from Winyah Bay. Individual megalopa were placed in separate incubation chambers. In the first experiment, water and sediment were changed daily as to mimic the megalopae’s nocturnal saltatorial transit up river based on transport model predictions. In a second experiment, megalopae were incubated at 20°, 25°, 30°C while receiving fresh river water daily. The rate of metamorphosis and survivorship of megalopae were calculated for each experiment and were used to develop a metamorphosis/survivorship function that will be utilized to calibrate our megalopae transport model. Actual on-river distribution of adult U. minax were determined by collecting crabs and conducting burrow counts at multiple sites along the Pee Dee River. Distribution data of adult crabs will be used to groundtruth the transport model for U. minax megalopae.

Fire ants are resistant to most insecticides, so control will require a more fundamental understanding of their biochemistry and metabolism leading to the design of selective, ecologically safe insecticides. The 4th instar larvae play a crucial role in the nutrition of the colony by secreting proteinases (especially chymotrypsin) which digest food products for the entire colony. The first structure of an ant proteolytic enzyme, fire ant chymotrypsin, was determined to atomic resolution (1.7 ANG). A structural comparison of the ant and mammalian structures confirms the "universality" of the serine proteinase motif and reveals a difference at residues 147-148, which are proteolytically removed in the bovine enzyme but are firmly intact in the ant chymotrypsin, suggesting a different activation mechanism for the latter. Likewise, the absence of the covalently attached propeptide domain (1-15) further suggests an uncharacteristic activation mechanism. The presence of Gly189 in the S1 site is an atypical feature of this chymotrypsin and is comparable only to human leukocyte elastase, hornet chymo-trypsin and fiddler crab collagenase. Binding studies confirm the chymotrypsin nature of this novel enzyme.

AB  - The burrowing crabs Chasmagnathus granulata and Uca uruguayensis are important bioturbators of intertidal flats in SW Atlantic estuaries reworking large amounts of sediment (C. granulata 2234.6 g m(-2) day(-1), U. uruguayenis 678.9 g m(-2) day(-1)) and influencing sediment quality and bedload transport. Their activities increase substrate penetrability. Organic matter and water content are higher in crab beds when compared with nearby areas without crabs. Burrows of U, uruguayensis are closed during high tide while burrows of C. granulata are always open effectively trapping clay and silt size particles rich in organic matter. This trapping of sediment enhances the effect of C. granulata in modifying sediment characteristics. Both species impact sediment erodability but have contrasting effects on sediment bedload transport. Daily bedload transport was lower inside C. granulata beds than outside, while it was higher in U. uruguayensis beds when compared with control areas. While C. granulata stabilizes the sediment by placing fine and cohesive sediment on the surface, U. uruguayensis disrupts the sediment by pelletizing it and making it more easily eroded. The contrasting activities of these two species may produce opposing and significant impacts on the structure of the benthic community because of their impact on sediment stability.

AB  - The intertidal burrowing crab Chasmagnathus granulatus is the dominant species in soft bare sediments and vegetated intertidal areas along the SW Atlantic estuaries (southern Brazil, 28 degrees S, to northern Patagonia, 42 degrees S). C. granulatus creates burrows that can reach densities of 60 burrows m(-2), and its burrowing activities increase water and organic matter content of sediments. To evaluate the long-term effect of burrows on the origin and transformation of accumulated organic matter within sediments, we compared C and N stable isotope signatures of sediments, plants, and consumers within areas with and without crabs. 15 N signatures of sediments and primary producers were enriched by 3 to 7 parts per thousand in areas with crabs. The enrichment was present in 4 different Argentine estuarine environments (Mar Chiquita coastal lagoon, 37 degrees 46'S, 57 degrees 19'W, Bahia Blanca, 38 degrees 50'S, 62 degrees 07'W, San Blas, 40 degrees 33'S, 62 degrees 14'W, San Antonio, 40 degrees 48'S, 64 degrees 52'W). Enrichment owing to crab activity appeared to overwhelm possible different N loads, anthropogenic influence, and other properties. Crab activity thus uncoupled the nitrogen dynamics in sediments from external controls. Enrichment of the heavier isotope of N could be the result of an increase in denitrification rates in areas with burrows. Crabs therefore forced faster transformation of available to unavailable nitrogen, making less inorganic nitrogen available to deeper waters. Food webs in areas with and without crabs were similar in shape, but less mobile benthic organisms (nematodes, fiddler crabs and the polychaete Laeonereis acuta) showed enriched N isotopic signatures. The benthic food web seemed separate from that of suspension feeders or water column consumers. Benthic microalgae were an important source for infauna, and marsh plants were particularly important for burrowing crabs.

AB  - In contrast to the large number of studies on the trophic significance of mangrove primary production to the aquatic foodweb, there have been few attempts to provide an overview of the relative importance of different primary carbon sources to invertebrates in the intertidal mangrove habitats. We determined carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios (delta(13)C, delta(15)N) in sediments, primary producers, and invertebrate species from an intertidal mangrove forest located along the southeast coast of India in order to determine the contribution of mangrove leaf litter and other carbon sources to the invertebrate community. Organic matter in sediments under the mangrove vegetation was characterized by relatively high delta(13)C values and low C:N ratios, indicating that mangrove-derived organic matter was not the principal source and that imported phytodetritus from the mangrove creeks and adjacent bay significantly contributed to the sediment organic matter pool. Invertebrates were found to display a wide range of delta(13)C values, most being 3-11parts per thousand enriched relative to the average mangrove leaf signal. The pulmonate gastropod Onchidium sp. showed unusually low delta(15)N values (-5.6+/-0.9parts per thousand), but further work is needed to adequately explain these data. A compilation of stable isotope data from various sources indicates that significant assimilation of mangrove-derived carbon is only detectable in a limited number of species, and suggests that local and imported algal sources are a major source of carbon for benthic invertebrate communities in intertidal mangrove forests. These results provide new insights into carbon utilization patterns in vegetated tropical intertidal habitats and show a striking similarity with results from temperate salt marsh ecosystems where local plant production has often been found to contribute little to intertidal foodwebs.

AB  - The major nitrogenous osmolytes present in the cells of marine invertebrates, notably the free amino acids glycine, alanine and proline, and trimethylamine oxide and betaine, are highly compatible with proper enzyme function and structure [Marine invertebrate species examined included Panulirus interruptus, Parastichopus parvimensis, Pachygrapsus crassipes, Unca crenulata and Grapsus grapsus. Comparisons were made with fresh water species (Procambarus clarkii and Anodonta sp.) and a rabbit.]. These nitrogenous osmolytes display either nonperturbing or favorable effects on enzyme-substrate and enzyme-cofactor complex formation, catalytic velocity and protein structural stability. In contrast, inorganic salts (KCl and NaCl) and certain of the free amino acids which play only a minor osmotic role, e.g., arginine and lysine, have strongly perturbing effects on one or more of these enzymic parameters. The compatible nitrogenous solutes therefore are suitable for use at high (several tenths molar) concentrations and at widely varying concentrations in osmoconforming species. Certain nitrogenous solutes, especially trimethylamine oxide, betaine and glutamate, offset some of the perturbing effects of inorganic ions on enzyme function. The selective accumulation of osmolytes thus involves not only the concentration of non-perturbing solutes, but also a balanced accumulation of solutes with opposing effects on enzymes. The selection of end-products of anaerobic metabolism also appears to be based, in part, on considerations of solute compatibility with enzyme function. Octopine is a non-perturbing solute, whereas arginine, which is condensed with pyruvate to form octopine, is very strongly perturbing. Succinate has marked stabilizing effects on protein structure. The composition of the intracellular fluids of marine invertebrates reflects selection for osmolytes and end-products whose net effects create a cellular microenvironment which is conducive to optimal enzyme function and structure. The accumulation of compatible solutes may preclude the necessity for widespread changes in protein structure in adapting to concentrated or highly variable osmotic environments.

AB  - Megalopae of 19 different taxa of brachyuran crabs were collected on passive collectors made from an artificial substrate at a single site within Charleston Harbor, South Carolina, in 1987-88. The blue crab Callinectes sapidus was the numerically dominant and most frequently collected species. Other numerically important taxa were mud crab Panopeus herbstii and fiddler crabs Uca spp. Settlement patterns were highly episodic, with approximately 42 % of the total number of megalopae collected on d single sampling date. Major settlement peaks for C sapidus megalopae occurred from August through October in both 1987 and 1988. Diel differences in abundance were apparent, with a significantly greater number of megalopae collected at night. Tidal range, wind speed, lunar phase, bottom water temperature, and bottom water salinity were correlated significantly with megalopal abundance. Megalopae of C. sapidus exhibited a semilunar pattern of settlement, with peak settlement occurring on waning phases of quarter moons. Juveniles constituted less than 0.3 % of the total catch of early crab instars and megalopae of C. sapidus, suggesting that ingress into estuarine habitats occurs at the megalopal stage. Other portunids apparently recruit to Charleston Harbor at the juvenile stage.

AB  - Salt marshes are frequently exposed to storm overwashes resulting in large deposits of sand and wrack at the margin of the high marsh and sand dune communities. On Cape Cod, MA, these disturbance-generated areas are dominated by burrows of the crab Uca pugilator and by nest entrances of the ants Formica subsericea and Tetramorium caespitum. We mimicked the effects of storm deposits through additions of sand and wrack and examined their effects on the distributions of the biotic structures of these organisms. We found that while crabs responded negatively to sand deposition, ants did so positively. We suggest that soil temperature and moisture explain these patterns. Wrack deposits extend higher the zone of moist soil and decrease evaporative stress for marine organisms such as crabs, whereas sandy areas tend to be drier and preferred by terrestrial ants. We conclude that disturbance type influences the distribution of these marine and terrestrial organisms over the ecotone.

AB  - The estuarine fiddler crabs, Uca minax, U. pugnax and U. pugilator, have complex life cycles spanning vastly different salinity regimes. Larvae are spawned in estuaries and travel to the coastal ocean where development takes place; after metamorphosing to the megalopal stage, fiddler crabs reinvade estuaries where they settle and metamorphose. In the coastal ocean, larvae experience relatively stable physical conditions, however, upon reinvading estuaries they are exposed to great fluxes in salinity and temperature. In this study, we measured shifts in the salinity regime caused by storm events, and determined the impact of these changes on species frequencies of megalopae from three Uca species in the water column and of their recently settled juvenile crabs on the benthos along a salt marsh creek in South Carolina. For megalopal stages in the water column, we found that the relative proportions of the three species changed significantly along salinity gradients and in response to storm events. When the salinity regime normalized, species frequencies for megalopae returned to pre-storm proportions. Only U. minax megalopae were present in the water column during a storm event, while U. pugnax had been the most abundant species in the water column prior to the storm. Settled juvenile crabs of all three species were more resilient than megalopae to flash salinity changes associated with summer freshets. Our results show that the duration and severity of salinity change are important variables impacting the presence of these Uca species in the water column and suggest that the physiology and behavior of the megalopal stage strongly influence where populations occur within estuaries.

AB  - Newly hatched larvae of the fiddler crab, Uca minax, ride nocturnal ebb currents away from low salinity adult habitats towards high salinity coastal marine environments where they complete development. We investigated the low salinity tolerance of zoeae in the laboratory to determine how this physiological trait impacts larval survival en-route to the sea. To do this, we compared the survivorship of fifty larvae reared at 27 ºC and 5 ‰ to fifty control larvae from the same brood reared at 25 ‰. We found an average L:D 50 of 13±1 SD days (range= 12-14.5 days; N=5 broods) at 5‰, with all larvae dead after an average of 16±1 SD days (range= 14-17 days). Survival of controls throughout the experimental period ranged between 90-96%. At 5‰, larvae did not progress past the second or third zoeal stage, while larvae reared at 25 ‰ (the controls) progressed normally to the postlarval stage. Preliminary work using the same experimental protocol on larvae reared at 0‰ shows that larvae are able to survive 2-3 days in freshwater. These salinity tolerance data combined with measurements of current velocities in tidal creeks and rivers and our understanding of larval swimming behaviors will be used to construct a model to predict the time needed to travel to the sea and the probability of surviving this journey from any release point along the inland population range of U. minax.

AB  - Three congeneric species of fiddler crabs, Uca pugilator (Bosc, 1802), U. pugnax (Smith, 1870), and U. minax (LeConte, 1855), co-occur in estuaries along the east coast of North America, from Cape Cod to northern Florida. Although U. minax adults are generally found at lower salinities than the other two species, the distributions of all three species overlap to some degree. The distribution of megalopae and juvenile fiddler crabs (from first crab stage to those with a carapace width of 3.0 mm) was examined at four sites along a salinity gradient (from 35.0&PLUSMN; 2.0% to 3.0&PLUSMN; 3.0%; (x) over bar &PLUSMN; SD) in the North Inlet Estuary, South Carolina, USA, in August 2002. A PCR-RFLP technique was developed to identify individuals from the genus Uca to species from first zoea through the early crab stages. An examination of the distribution of early life stages showed that U. minax reinvades low-salinity adult habitats at settlement, following planktonic larval development in the coastal ocean. Also, juveniles of U. pugilator were found to occupy Spartina alterniflora stands, where adult conspecifics rarely occur. Species frequencies were different for adults compared to early life stages in low-salinity areas of the marsh, where populations overlap. Settlement and survival dynamics of early life-history stages in wet and dry years likely determine the distribution of adult Uca spp. populations along salinity gradients in estuarine ecosystems.

AB  - The estuarine fiddler crabs, Uca minax, U. pugnax and U. pugilator, have complex life cycles spanning vastly different salinity regimes. Larvae are spawned in estuaries and travel to the coastal ocean where development takes place; after metamorphosing to the megalopal stage, fiddler crabs reinvade estuaries where they settle and metamorphose. In the coastal ocean, larvae experience relatively stable physical conditions, however, upon reinvading estuaries they are exposed to great fluxes in salinity and temperature. In this study, we measured shifts in the salinity regime caused by storm events, and determined the impact of these changes on species frequencies of megalopae from three Uca species in the water column and of their recently settled juvenile crabs on the benthos along a salt marsh creek in South Carolina. For megalopal stages in the water column, we found that the relative proportions of the three species changed significantly along salinity gradients and in response to storm events. When the salinity regime normalized, species frequencies for megalopae returned to pre-storm proportions. Only U. minax megalopae were present in the water column during a storm event, while U. pugnax had been the most abundant species in the water column prior to the storm. Settled juvenile crabs of all three species were more resilient than megalopae to flash salinity changes associated with summer freshets. Our results show that the duration and severity of salinity change are important variables impacting the presence of these Uca species in the water column and suggest that the physiology and behavior of the megalopal stage strongly influence where populations occur within estuaries.

AB  - Many invertebrates that have invaded low salinity and freshwater environments from the sea have retained marine planktonic larval development. In these taxa, early life stages must survive a broad range of physical conditions as they travel from the ocean to settlement sites in areas where adults reside. We investigated the settlement strategies of three brackish water fiddler crabs from the Southeastern United States that undergo larval development in coastal marine waters, but live as adults along the banks of tidally-influenced rivers and creeks. Two of these species—U. pugilator and U. pugnax— occupy habitats with intermediate salinities, while U. minax dominates in low salinity and freshwater areas. We collected recently settled crabs along a salinity gradient to address three alternative hypotheses for each species: 1. Young crabs leave the ocean and settle directly into adult habitats. 2. Young crabs invade brackish water environments gradually as they develop and grow, arriving at adult habitats as older juveniles. 3. Young crabs settle randomly throughout brackish water systems, dying out in areas that are not suitable for them. Young individuals from these three fiddler species were identified using a Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism molecular analysis because they cannot be distinguished based on morphology. This work forms the basis for future investigations of the behavioral and physiological adaptations in the early life stages of freshwater invading crabs.

AB  - Dense populations of the fiddler crab Uca minax (Le Conte 1855) are common along tidally influenced freshwater rivers and streams > 50 km from the sea. Adults do not migrate from inland sites to release larvae, but instead release them directly into an environment where the zoeae cannot survive. Laboratory salinity tolerance experiments were used to determine how long larvae from the inland-most population of U. minax along the Pee Dee River, South Carolina, USA can survive zero salinity compared to larvae from a brackish water population (salinity 5) near the mouth of Winyah Bay in the same estuary. Larvae from the brackish water population were also exposed to a salinity of 5 and their survival tracked. These experiments were conducted from May to August 2004 and 2005. To determine if inland larvae suffered significant mortality in transit due to salinity stress, current profiles were measured in the field and used to model the time taken by a larva using ebb-tide transport to travel to permissive salinities. The laboratory tolerance experiments showed that larvae from the inland freshwater population had LT50's of 4-5 days at 0 salinity, which were significantly longer than those of the brackish water zoeae (2-3 days). Zoeae from the brackish water population survived for at least one larval molt at a salinity of 5 with LT 50's of similar to 12 days. Estimated travel times to reach permissive salinities from the inland-most population based on current profiles were 3-5 days for larvae using night-time only ebb-tide transport and 1.5-2.5 days for those using ebb-tide transport both day and night. Previously published field data indicate that U. minax larvae do use both day- and night-time ebb-tide transport, and are found in high densities in the water column during the day. These results lead to the conclusion that U. minax stage I zoeae do not undergo significant salinity-induced mortality during their 50+ km trip to the sea.

AB  - Mangroves are common along the coast of Zanzibar. The mudflats around them are inhabited by fiddler crabs (Uca marionis) and Periophthalmus, a decimeter-long fish common around the mangrove roots or partially buried in the mud. The sand strands are mostly inhabited by ghost crabs (Oxypode sp.) but the lagoons harbor a rich fauna. Common are Diadema setosum, Parasalenia gratiosa and sea cucumbers like the blue Actinopyge lecanora, the brown Holothuria atra and a meter-long Synapta sp. Starfish such as Oreaster australis and Culcita novaeguinea are also common. Sea anemones also occur in the lagoons. The coral reefs are dominated by Poris lutea and various species of Acropora, usually very colorful. Of the smaller corals the red Tubipora musica is common in low water and even in the lagoons. Mollusks are common in the reefs with the genus Cyprea represented by more than 60 spp. Conus is also well represented. Tridacna gigas is uncommon but T. croeca occurs in numbers. Numerous species of fish also inhabit the reefs. The reefs around Zanzibar appear to be in good shape but oil spills are a danger as are other human activities.

AB  - Brachyuran larvae were sampled every two hours at two depths in Indian River Inlet over six consecutive tidal cycles. Larvae from seven taxa were collected. Three taxa were identified at the level of species. Pinnixa spp. and Uca spp. zoeae were most common at the surface on ebbing tides and were apparently exported to coastal shelf waters. Uca spp. and Callinectes sapidus megalopae were common near the bottom on flooding tides. This would promote retention in the estuary and is consistent with previous reports in the literature. Ovalipes ocellatus, Cancer irroratus and Libinia spp. were most common on flooding tides. This suggests that a pool of these larvae existed in adjacent coastal waters, and that these larvae were carried into the inlet on flooding tides.

AB  - The gastric teeth of three ocypodoid species were investigated using scanning electron microscopy, and the morphological results were discussed with respect to the known food preferences. The species were chosen in particular because of contrasting ideas about their relationships within the Thoracotremata. For the genera Heloecius, Dotilla, Mictyris, and "Uca'' (s. str.), we find a specific correlation of the gastric teeth with the suspension feeding. The lateral gastric teeth of Uca have no prominent lateral teeth cusps, and most of their teeth surface consists of transverse comb-like lamellae. However, this possible food adaptation does not exclude the usability of specific teeth characters to distinguish species of suspension feeders. The closer relationship of the Dotillidae to grapsoid lines of gecarcinid or sesarmid crabs suggested by molecular data is not supported by the gastric teeth. For the genus Ucides, we found several characters that distinguish Ucides from the remaining ocypodoid genera Heloecius, Dotilla, Mictyris, and "Uca.'' In particular, the structures of the lateral and the dorsomedian teeth show some similarities to genera of the Gecarcinidae and Sesarmidae. Our results suggest that foregut characters can be used for phylogenetic analyses. J. Morphol. 272: 1109-1115, 2011. (C) 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - The Asian shore crab, Hemigrapsus sanguineus, was observed occupying fiddler crab burrows (Uca pugnax) at low tide in a Spartina salt marsh at Sherwood Island, Westport, Connecticut. Forty-seven percent (48/103) of the fiddler crab burrows censused were occupied by crabs. Of those, 81% held fiddler crabs while the remainder held Asian crabs. Fiddler crabs and Asian crabs were never found in the same burrow. Unlike the Asian crab, fiddler crabs preferred areas of the "marsh edge" where rocks and small stones were not present. Hemigrapsus sanguineus, which can be found under the shelter of rocks, shells, and other debris on tidal flats along the fringes of the marsh, probably searches the marsh edge as the tide recedes for unused burrows to occupy. Field caging experiments used to investigate possible competitive interactions between these two species indicated that the presence of the Asian crab had no effect on burrow utilization by the fiddler crab. It is unlikely that patterns of habitat use by the east coast salt marsh fiddler crab, Uca pugnax, will be significantly affected by the recent introduction of the Asian crab, H. sanguineus, to this area.

AB  - Hatching and adult behavioral cycles in Uca pugnax and Uca minax were studied in Cheesequake salt marsh, New Jersey. Cheesequake Creek has semi-diurnal tides; the water column was mixed during a spring tide and stratified during a neap tide. Calibration experiments of egg development time course, and weekly field collections of ovigerous females, were used to produce seasonal hatching profiles in 1980-1981. Calibration curves were fit with polynomial regression. Both species had asynchronous hatching in June. Subsequently, hatching peaks were associated with syzygies through late August in U. pugnax. U. minax hatching peaks in 1981 were associated with syzygies near 1 and 17 July; in 1980 minor peaks were associated with syzygies on 29 June and 12 July, with a larger peak near 2 July. Lack of consistent hatching rhythms in U. minax may have been caused by shortness of the reproductive season. Uca hatching peaks generally occur on nocturnal high tides, which typically occur near syzygies. This pattern may enhance downstream dispersal of zoeae, reduce potential physiological stress of low salinity or high water temperature, and reduce predation risk for zoeae and releasing females. Semi-lunar and seasonal cycles of adult behavior were evident for both species in 1979-1980. Daily periods of maximum social activity had higher air temperatures and clearer skies during spring tides than during neap tides. Active behaviors were associated with spring tides; during neap tides crabs tended to remain in or near their burrows. R-type factor analysis, with varimax rotation, identified behavioral patterns. Ten factors were retained, explaining 60.7% of behavioral variance. Factor 1 represented lower phases of social behavior; peak scores were associated with spring tides. Factors 2 and 4 represented aggressive wandering and courtship, respectively; peak scores of both were associated with syzygies. Seasonal patterns of hatching and courtship were similar. Courtship and hatching may be linked, so that a rhythm in one could follow from the other. If long-term sperm storage is possible, courtship and hatching need not be linked; the rhythms could be independent responses to the semi-lunar schedule of tidal inundation.

AB  - Studies of diet choice by omnivores have the potential to form conceptual links between studies of diet choice by herbivores, frugivores, detritivores, and predators. We examined diet choice in the omnivorous salt marsh crab Armases cinereum (=Sesarma cinereum (Grapsidae)) in a series of laboratory experiments. Armases is sexually dimorphic; with larger males having relatively larger claws than females. In a growth experiment, an invertebrate diet supported better growth than any other single diet; however, growth also occurred on single diets of mud, leaf litter or fresh leaves. Mixed diets provided the best growth. If alternative foods were available, consumption of leaf litter and fresh leaves decreased, but these items were not dropped from the diet completely. In contrast, consumption of invertebrate prey was not affected by the availability of alternative foods. In a predation experiment, crustacean prey (an amphipod and an isopod) were more vulnerable to predation by Armases than were two small gastropod species. Only large male Armases were able to consume large numbers of gastropods. Environmental structure (plant litter or litter mimics) reduced predation rates, especially on crustaceans, which actively utilized the structure to hide from predators. Armases consumes a mixed diet because several factors (prey physical defenses, avoidance behavior of prey, growth benefits of a mixed diet) favor omnivory over a specialized diet. Similar factors may promote minor amounts of "omnivory" by species generally considered to be herbivores, frugivores, detritivores, and predators. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Male and female Uca tangeri (the only fiddler crab species to inhabit Europe) construct mudballs from mud excavated from within their burrows. Individual males placed similar patterns of mudballs each low tide, suggesting that there is some degree of stereotypy. When mudballs were experimentally moved further from the burrow or closer to it, males only repositioned those that were moved closer, placing them further away again. However, males did not replace mudballs that had been experimentally destroyed at the end of the mudballing phase when they had started to court females. In binary presentation tests, females showed no significant differences in response to mudballs made from different types of mud, or different numbers of mudballs. These results are consistent with earlier findings that male mudballs function as territory boundaries. However, we provide evidence that male mudballs have no function in female attraction, contrasting with previous studies.

AB  - This study investigated the features of mudballs produced by mate and female Uca annulipes. Both sexes formed mudballs front mud excavated from Within the burrow during the final hour of the low tide period. Males placed the centre of the mudball aggregation and the furthest mudball significantly further front the burrow than females. These observations suggest that the placement of male mudballs was not simply a by-product of burrow excavation.

AB  - At each low tide, male and female Uca tangeri remove mudballs from inside their burrows and place them on the surface. Previous studies have shown clear intersexual differences in mudball arrangements. However, we noticed that some females placed their mudballs in an arrangement similar to that of males. In this study, we investigated several factors that may have been responsible for this change in female mudballing behavior. We found no significant effect of the lunar cycle, female size and reproductive state, or burrow features. We briefly discuss the avoidance of sexual coercion or parasite modification of host behavior as possible factors. Our study shows that intersexual differences in mudballing behavior are more complex than previously thought.

AB  - The immediate effects of oil on the behavior of fiddler crabs (Uca pugnax) following the 2 January 1990 Exxon of No. 2 heating oil spill in the Arthur Kill between Staten Island, New York and New Jersey were studied. Despite winter temperatures, fiddler crabs in contaminated creeks left their subterranean burrows and were found on the surface of the oily mud. The behavior of control crabs (collected in the Arthur Kill region in mid-September or dug up in early February from uncontaminated creeks in the Arthur Kill region), were compared with those exposed on the surface for varying periods of time. There were significant differences in behavior between control and oil-exposed crabs for all behaviors measured including righting response, locomotion, ability to move up an incline, ability to grip an inclining plane, and aggressive or defensive behaviors. Control crabs could right themselves in less than a second whereas exposed crabs required over 2 sec., and many could not right themselves at all. All control crabs moved > 10 cm on a flat surface or an incline, whereas 29-53% of the exposed crabs did not move. Similarly, defensive behaviors were less intense or nonexistent in exposed crabs compared to control crabs.

AB  - Following a spill of 567 000 gallons of No. 2 fuel oil into the Arthur Kill in New York and New Jersey in January 1990 we studied the emergence and mortality of fiddler crabs. We (1) compared seven salt marsh creeks immediately adjacent to the oil spill with 23 creeks at varying distances from the spill; (2) examined the temporal pattern of emergence in one creek; and (3) compared mortality rate of crabs that emerged with those we dug up. Twice as many crabs emerged in the adjacent creeks compared to those that were only 4.5 km away. There were significant differences in the number of crabs that emerged as a function of distance from the spill. Crabs continued to emerge until mid-March. For all the emerged crabs, the percentage of females ranged from 28 to 80, whereas the percentage of females in intact burrows was 64-65%. For all emerged samples, females died earlier than males. In the laboratory, all emerged crabs died within four weeks whereas over 90% of the controls were still alive eight weeks after the initiation of the experiment.

AB  - An oil spill on 2 January 1990 in New Jersey resulted in premature emergence of fiddler crabs Uca pugnax from their underground burrows. Live fiddler crabs that emerged on the surface were collected and behavioral changes were compared between those that were washed with freshwater and those that were not washed. Locomotion, aggression, balance. and burrowing behavior were examined. Unwashed crabs improved significantly on only one of twelve behavioral tests. while washed crabs improved in four tests relating to movement, defensive behavior, and burrowing. The washed crabs showed the greater improvement on ten of twelve tests while unwashed crabs showed greater improvement for two tests. Washed crabs also showed greater improvement in their ability to find and to construct their own burrows. These experiments indicate that oil removal improves the behavioral performance of crabs, and suggests that under some circumstances the immediate flushing of salt marsh creeks by uncontaminated tidal waters may decrease behavioral effects on crabs.

AB  - Arthropods have a non-living exoskeleton that is composed of a lipoprotein epicuticle, underlying exocuticle and deeper thick endocuticle. The deepest component, the membranous layer, is an uncalcified zone immediately above a sheet of epithelial cells called the hypodermis. Molting, or ecdysis, is achieved when the animal manufactures a new exoskeleton, separates from and then crawls out of the old exoskeleton. Under the influence of a group of invertebrate steroids named ecdysteroids, hypodermal cells secrete a hydrolytic molting fluid that begins digesting the membranous layer. As hydrolysis completes, the endocuticle separates from the hypodermis by a process termed apolysis. We report here preliminary results investigating the role of ecdysteroids in regulation of apolysis. Hemolymph ecdysteroid titers from fiddler crabs forced to molt by multiple autotomy (reflexive loss of limbs) were quantified by radioimmunoassay. Two distinct titer trends have emerged. Certain crabs follow the short cycle. A rise in hemolymph ecdysteroid levels occurs at R3 (relative growth indicator determined by dividing the limb bud length by the carapace width) of about 16, limb buds continue to grow and the group molts within 3 – 5 weeks after autotomy. This premolt hormone peak evidently initiates apolysis. Some animals did not progress through the molt cycle with their cohorts. Their ecdysteroid titers remained low, limb buds did not grow and hormone levels did not peak during premolt. These crabs, following a long cycle, did not molt with their cohorts. Instead, all specimens not sacrificed died without molting. It appears that this premolt peak of ecdysteroids is necessary for completion of the molt cycle. We are currently completing studies that will correlate the hormone titers from experimental crabs with the completion of apolysis.

AB  - Crustaceans, like many other invertebrates and some vertebrates, are capable of altering their color by altering the degree of pigment concentration or dispersion in specialized integumental cells known as chromatophores. Pigment translocation in the fiddler crab, Uca pugilator, is regulated by hormones released from the animal's eyestalk neuroendocrine gland, the X-organ-sinus gland complex. This complex contains no fewer than four pigment effector hormones. The release of these hormones is thought to be regulated by neurons impinging directly on the secretory cells, or on cells somewhere along the chain of neurons leading to the X-organ-sinus gland (Fingerman, 1985). Biogenic amines, including dopamine, octopamine, 5-hydroxytryptamine, and norepinephrine, have been shown to have hormone-releasing effects when injected into U. pugilator. Whether or not endogenous stores of these compounds act as neurotransmitters, however, has not been fully illustrated. In the following work, I have documented the presence of dopamine, octopamine, norepinephrine and 5-hydroxytryptamine in various tissues of U. pugilator. In addition, I have provided evidence for a mechanism of synthesis of one (5-hydroxytryptamine) using pharmacological blockers against enzymes involved in its synthesis. I have also demonstrated a mechanism whereby the action of one (norepinephrine) is terminated by re-uptake and metabolism of this putitive neurotransmitter. In the final chapter, the relationship of biogenic amines and eyestalk neuropeptides, was examined.

AB  - The vertebrate pineal hormone melatonin has protective effects in the mammalian nervous system. These effects are both receptor-mediated and non-receptor-mediated. Melatonin has not been extensively studied in invertebrates; however, invertebrates do produce melatonin, with daily variations that suggest a circadian pattern as in vertebrates. Crustaceans respond to exogenous melatonin with changes in activity patterns, glucose metabolism, and cardiac rate, all of which are influenced also by well-characterized neuropeptide products of the x-organ/sinus gland system in the eyestalk. We studied the influence of melatonin on neurite growth of x-organ cells from the fiddler crab Uca pugilator. In culture, these cells grow neurites with extensive arborizations within the first 48 hr. Melatonin, 1 M, 1nM, and 1 pM, significantly increased neurite growth versus control cells after 24 hr in culture. The physiological concentrations, 1 nM and 1 pM, increased growth at 48 hr also, whereas the pharmacological 1M dosage showed desensitizing effects by this time. Luzindole, a vertebrate melatonin receptor antagonist, had agonist-like activity in these crustacean cells, indicating a potentially different type of membrane receptor from vertebrates. Melatonin also had protective effects, reversing the neurite-inhibiting administration of hydrogen peroxide. This neuroprotective influence of melatonin is likely due to the ubiquitous ability of melatonin to scavenge free radicals directly. Results of this study indicate roles of melatonin in the crustacean nervous system that are analogous to its roles in the vertebrate nervous system.

AB  - 1.Contests between conspecific males are an important method of establishing mating rights or territories, yet the potential costs of injuries are high. To reduce potential risks, males can use signals to convey information about their underlying strength to competitors, and although individuals could signal deceptively to gain an advantage, most signals seem to be reliable. 2.Theory suggests that signal reliability is maintained because individuals that signal unreliably may be punished (i.e. receiver-imposed costs). Manipulative studies support this idea, showing that low-quality individuals that are given high-quality signals bear substantial costs. 3.Here, we explore the importance of receiver-imposed costs in natural, un-manipulated populations. Specifically, we show how the likelihood of being exposed (i.e. potential receiver density) and the potential severity of punishment (i.e. average receiver size) affect the predominance of unreliable signalling among populations. 4.Male fiddler crabs, Uca vomeris, use their enlarged claws as signals and weapons in combat, and the relationship between claw size (signal) and strength (quality) determines whether or not a male is a reliable signaller. We predicted that the prevalence of unreliable signalling among individual males would increase in populations where the receiver-imposed costs of deception were low. That is, males should produce unreliable (large but weak) claws. 5.We show that individual crabs produce more reliable signals of strength in populations with a high biomass, where there are both higher densities and larger average body sizes of potential receivers. Our study provides evidence that receiver-imposed costs can maintain signal reliability in natural un-manipulated populations and supports contemporary models of aggressive signalling.

AB  - Physical strength and resource value are two key determinants of fighting success in most species. We investigated the role that resource value plays in determining fight outcome for a territory centred on a burrow in a fiddler crab, Uca annulipes. Males fought harder (escalated fights) for a territory during the mating period (when the burrow is also used for mating and breeding) than in the nonmating period (when it has value as a shelter). In both periods, having a burrow also allows access to the surrounding mudflat surface, where crabs forage. We confirmed earlier studies showing that males with regenerated claws are weaker competitors that are disproportionately evicted from their burrow during the nonmating period. Unexpectedly, however, males with a regenerated claw were not disproportionately evicted during the mating period. Fights at this time were also more escalated. We suggest this is because, when the disputed resource is also required for breeding, even weak males need to obtain and defend a burrow if they are to accrue any fitness. During the mating period, individuals with low resource-holding potential can improve their chances of mating if they escalate fights for burrows.

AB  - Fiddler crabs live at high densities and mate-searching females encounter many males at varying distances. Who is the ideal neighbour for a male? There could be a trade-off if having neighbours that invest more in sexual signals increases the rate at which females initially move towards a focal male, but thereafter decrease the likelihood that he is chosen rather than his neighbour. We used robotic crabs to test whether female choice for focal males (identical claw size/courtship wave rate) varied depending on the relative investment in sexual signals of their two neighbours and the distance at which she first saw the males. The neighbours' phenotype did not affect which of two focal males she initially approached from long-range (50 cm). When a female initially saw a trio of males at a close-range (20 cm), she preferentially chose the focal male over neighbours that invested less in sexual signals (smaller claw/slower wave rate), but did not show a preference for the focal male over neighbours that invested more in sexual signals (larger claw/faster wave rate). However, a female that started to approach a focal male with neighbours that invest more in sexual signals from 50 cm was significantly less likely to choose the focal male than when she first saw the trio at 20 cm. Our results suggest that the initial distance at which males are seen partly determines how neighbours' sexual signals affect male mating success. In general, if larger males can retain smaller neighbours they might therefore increase their mating success.

AB  - How do females select a mate when they have mating preferences for multiple male traits? In experimental studies, female fiddler crabs (Uca mjoebergi) show a strong preference for males with larger claws and higher wave rates. In the field, there is no correlation between male claw size and observed wave rate. Here we document natural mating behaviour and show that females approach males who wave at a higher rate than nearby competitors. On average, an approached male had a significantly larger claw than his two nearest neighbours but did not differ in size from his two closest waving competitors. In general, smaller males were less likely to wave at approaching females. Females therefore approached mates based directly on wave rate but, because smaller males were less likely to wave, this indirectly resulted in female choice for larger than average males. Our study raises two issues. First, how do we relate the field results to previous experimental studies showing a female preference for larger claws? Second, in U. mjoebergi, males defend smaller neighbours against intruders. Our study suggests that one benefit of such defence coalitions is to decrease the number of immediate competitors present during female mate choice by retaining smaller neighbours.

AB  - Males often possess traits, such as horns, claws, and tusks, which are used during male-male combat. Studies suggest that selection has fine tuned these weapons to improve their effectiveness and that the shape of these weapons provides cues for males to assess the strength of rivals. Similarly, females might also assess a male's weaponry to determine his value as a mate. The largest weapon relative to body size is the major claw of male fiddler crabs (genus: Uca). Males use their claws both as a weapon and as a courtship signal, waving it to attract females. We used robotic crabs in two-choice experiments to test female mating preferences based on male claw shape in Uca mjoebergi. First, females did not prefer conspecific claws over any of three alternatively shaped stimuli matched for color and for the rate and pattern of waving. The alternative stimuli were two different heterospecific claws and a plain rectangular shape. Second, females significantly preferred the alternative stimuli when they were presented at a faster wave rate. We conclude that claw shape in U. mjoebergi has not evolved under sexual selection imposed by female mating preferences and is more likely to have evolved under selection for effectiveness during male-male competition.

AB  - The monomeric subunit composition of the hemocyanin of the sand fiddler crab Uca pugilator was examined in six samples totalling 342 individuals and representing latitudinal and salinity gradients. A total of 12 different polypeptide chains were separated electrophoretically, of which as few as four and as many as nine were present in an individual. The small quantities of several chains suggest a mixed population of the predominantly 2 x 6 aggregates in the blood. There was no effect of sex and no clear effect of salinity. Samples of populations found near the northern and southern limits of the species, however, were very different from each other and also from samples of populations in the middle of the geographic range. Specifically, samples from the geographic limits exhibit far less variation than those from the middle of the species range. Only one group of three minor chains clearly varies as if they might be encoded at the same locus. Moreover, the condition of most of the monomers, including those three as well as several of the major chains, is not genetically fixed in the adult stage.

AB  - Brachyuran larvae were sampled every two hours at two depths in Indian River Inlet over six consecutive tidal cycles. Larvae from seven taxa were collected. Three taxa were identified at the level of species. Pinnixa spp. and Uca spp. zoeae were most common at the surface on ebbing tides and were apparently exported to coastal shelf waters. Uca spp. and Callinectes sapidus megalopae were common near the bottom on flooding tides. This would promote retention in the estuary and is consistent with previous reports in the literature. Ovalipes ocellatus, Cancer irroratus and Libinia spp. were most common on flooding tides. This suggests that a pool of these larvae existed in adjacent coastal waters, and that these larvae were carried into the inlet on flooding tides.

AB  - Mangrove forests are known to accomplish crucial ecosystem functions and services. They are nursery areas for fish, prawns and crabs, which provide coastal communities with a variety of food, timber and chemicals, and protect coasts from catastrophic events, such as tsunamis. Recently, a novel ecological service has been proposed for mangrove systems, namely natural wastewater treatment wetlands. This hypothesis was based on experimental data collected mainly in Chinese mangrove systems, which proved that mangrove soils were efficient in absorbing nutrients. Moreover, sewage loading seemed harmless to both plants and benthic communities in these systems. However, before promoting the use of natural mangroves as pollution buffers, or constructed mangrove wetlands as sewage treatment facilities, more data are needed on their overall tolerance to organic loading. Differences in macro-benthos patterns were thus investigated between peri-urban mangroves and sites not affected by sewage disposal in East Africa. We assessed differences in epifaunal assemblages, comprising crabs and molluscs, employing multivariate ACI unbalanced analyses to compare peri-urban mangrove swamps with those characteristic of non-urban mangroves with similar ecological traits. The sampling design was spatially nested, replicates being assessed at equatorial (southern Kenya) and subtropical (southern Mozambique) sites. The results manifested a consistent increase in crab biomass at the peri-urban sites in both Kenya and Mozambique. Moreover, the peri-urban systems were richer than the non-urban mangroves, both in terms of fiddler crabs (Uca spp.) which feed on benthic microalgae and bacteria, and sesarmids, such as Penisesarma guttatum and Neosarmatium meinerti, which feed on both substratum and leaf litter. The abundance of gastropods, in contrast, decreased significantly, especially in Kenya, mainly due to the disappearance of the mud whelk Terebralia palustris. The results thus indicate that, in East African mangrove systems, domestic wastewater has detectable effects on crabs and molluscs, suggesting their usefulness as bioindicators of its effects in mangroves. Transformed benthic patterns at the peri-urban sites indicated the need for further study of the actual potential of natural mangrove forests to absorb pollution in sewage treatment.

AB  - This field study investigated the spatial strategies and homing ability of two East African fiddler crabs, Uca lactea annulipes and Uca vocans hesperiae, using various experimental procedures. A clear-cut spatial segregation between the two species was observed, with U. l. annulipes occupying areas even a few centimetres above U. v. hesperiae. Females of both species were extremely faithful to their holes while the males exhibited behavioural differences. U. l. annulipes males were quite faithful to their holes; in contrast, U. v. hesperiae males, during a single low tide, visited several holes which they did not defend. Two displacement experiments were conducted in order to identify the stimuli that fiddler crabs use in their homing. In the 'dislocation experiment', the crabs were moved (by hand) 1 or 2m away from their refuge and released. None of these crabs returned to its burrow and, moreover, the initial directions they followed were not homeward orientated. In the 'translation experiment', the crabs were passively translated while actively feeding. When the crabs attempted to go 'home' after the translation, they darted along a straight path that led them to points that would have corresponded to their homes if the translation had not taken place. After this first response crabs then commenced searching strategies that led half of them home. Short-range homing seems to depend strongly on information actively gathered during the outward journey, other than local visual landmarks.

AB  - Shortly after spawning, zoeae of the red-jointed fiddler crab, Uca minax, were exposed to 1.0, 0.5 and 0.1 mg l-1 of the insecticide carbaryl. Exposed zoeae were observed for fatalities, changes in phototaxis, and altered swimming behavior. Fifty per cent mortalities in these concentrations occurred after 12.5, 14.5 and 25 h, respectively. Zoeae displayed a rapid loss of positive phototaxis, which occurred after 2, 4 and 16 h, respectively. Abnormal swimming behavior was observed in all exposed groups, with total cessation of swimming activity occurring in 6 hours in groups I and II and 16 hours in group III.

AB  - Zoeae of three species of temperate zone fiddler crabs, Uca pugnax, U. minax, and U. pugilator, were reared in the laboratory. The zoeae of each species were placed individually in artificial salinity gradients and observed for specific salinity preferences. Each species of zoeae displayed a salinity preference that reflected the salinity patterns of the adult crabs of the same species. Zoeae of U. pugnax and U. pugilator, like the adult crabs, displayed a preference for higher salinities (i.e., 20.6 parts per thousand +/- 3.5 and 21.5 parts per thousand +/- 3.0, respectively). Zoeae of U. minax, like the adult crabs, displayed a preference for lower salinities (i.e., 9.8 parts per thousand +/- 2.9).

AB  - Time activity budgets of the Gulf Coast fiddler crab Uca panacea were investigated to determine the importance of season, sex and body size on partitioning time to the following behaviors: foraging, maintenance, time in burrow, time inactive and social interaction. During the nonbreeding season, all crabs spent a majority of time foraging (66%) followed by burrow occupation (18.6%), whereas in the breeding season, time allocated to foraging (37.2%) and burrow occupation (41.6%) was nearly equal. Males spent significantly more time in social behavior than females. Body size had the least impact on fiddler crab time activity budgets. Predator pressure and abiotic factors were hypothesized to be most important in shaping activity budgets.

AB  - The allometric growth of Uca leptodacyla from two distinct subtropical estuaries on the Brazilian coast was evaluated concerning its growth pattern and size at onset of sexual maturity. Females attained maturity at similar sizes in both sites (4.1 mm of carapace length in Indaia and 4.2 mm in Ubatumirim), while males differed slightly. They reached the size at sexual maturity of 5.3 mm of carapace length in Indaia and 4.6 mm in Ubatumirim. Growth pattern is Usually similar among crabs from distinct Sites while size at sexual maturity is frequently different. However, in the case of U. leptodacyla it did not occur, probably due to the strong habitat similarity and intrinsic features of this species.

AB  - The vertebrate pineal hormone melatonin has protective effects in the mammalian nervous system. These effects are both receptor-mediated and non-receptor-mediated. Melatonin has not been extensively studied in invertebrates; however, invertebrates do produce melatonin, with daily variations that suggest a circadian pattern as in vertebrates. Crustaceans respond to exogenous melatonin with changes in activity patterns, glucose metabolism, and cardiac rate, all of which are influenced also by well-characterized neuropeptide products of the x-organ/sinus gland system in the eyestalk. We studied the influence of melatonin on neurite growth of x-organ cells from the fiddler crab Uca pugilator. In culture, these cells grow neurites with extensive arborizations within the first 48 hr. Melatonin, 1 M, 1nM, and 1 pM, significantly increased neurite growth versus control cells after 24 hr in culture. The physiological concentrations, 1 nM and 1 pM, increased growth at 48 hr also, whereas the pharmacological 1M dosage showed desensitizing effects by this time. Luzindole, a vertebrate melatonin receptor antagonist, had agonist-like activity in these crustacean cells, indicating a potentially different type of membrane receptor from vertebrates. Melatonin also had protective effects, reversing the neurite-inhibiting administration of hydrogen peroxide. This neuroprotective influence of melatonin is likely due to the ubiquitous ability of melatonin to scavenge free radicals directly. Results of this study indicate roles of melatonin in the crustacean nervous system that are analogous to its roles in the vertebrate nervous system.

AB  - The structure of two populations of the fiddler crab Uca rapax in two subtropical mangrove habitats near Ubatuba, State of Sao Paulo, Brazil were compared. The size - frequency distribution, sex ratio, and recruitment were evaluated. Sampling was performed monthly from April 2001 to March 2002 in the Itamambuca and Ubatumirim habitats. Crabs were caught manually for 15 min by two collectors during low tide. The carapace width of each crab was measured with a digital caliper, and the sex and ovigerous state were recorded. The median size of the carapace width of males was greater than that of females at both sites (P<0.05). The median size of the crabs from Itamambuca was larger than at Ubatumirim (P<0.05). Only 28 ovigerous females were obtained from both mangroves, which suggested that females might remain in their burrows during the incubation period. The highest recruitment pulse occurred in winter for both populations, probably as a consequence of high reproductive activity during summer. The sex ratio in the size classes showed an anomalous pattern, with a higher frequency of females in the intermediate size classes. This may be related to a greater energy requirement for reproduction in females, thus delaying growth. The variable environmental conditions to which Uca rapax populations are subject appear to act directly or indirectly on the population, causing variations in growth and reproductive processes in the different populations investigated here.

AB  - This present work describes the reproductive cycle of Uca rapax (Smith, 1870) based on observations of their gonadal development and molt cycles in a degraded mangrove area in Paraty, State of Rio de Janeiro. Two collectors captured the crabs monthly (from July 2001 to June 2002) during 15 minutes by procedure of capture per unit effort in low tide periods. Crabs were sexed, measured (carapace width -CW; 0.01 mm precision) and females were checked for eggs. Crab' stages of gonad development of both sexes were determined by direct and macroscopic observation and molt stage was estimated by the hardness of the tegument. A total of 1,558 specimens were collected, being 801 males and 757 females (16 ovigerous females). Ovigerous females accounted only about 3% of the population, perhaps because females usually remain underground in closed burrows during the incubation, which can nor be seen easily in the field. Crabs with mature gonads were found year-round, but most reproduction in U. rapax Occurred during the warmer months of the year (spring-summer). The frequency of crabs in molt activity was lower (12.8%) than intermolt crabs. Probably, U. rapax burrowed in this critic period that is the change of exoskeleton, minimizing the risks imposed by the occurrence of a soft skeleton. Despite of U. rapax be occuring in a properly degraded man.-rove, its reproductive cycle seems to be not affected by the habitat condition,when it is compared with areas of the man.-roves no impacted by human action. This fact is Supported by the presence of potentially Mature crabs year-round at the study area.

AB  - The morphology of the ovaries in Uco rapax (Smith, 1870) was described based on macroscopic and microscopic analysis. Females were collected in Itamambuca mangrove, Ubatuba, state of Sao Paulo, Brazil. In the laboratory, 18 females had their ovaries removed and prepared for histology. Each gonad developmental stage was previously determined based on external and macroscopic morphology and afterwards each stage was microscopically described. The ovaries of U. rapax showed a pronounced macroscopic differentiation in size and coloration with the maturation of the gonad, with six ovarian developmental stages: immature, rudimentary, developing, developed, advanced and spent. During the vitellogenesis, the amount of oocytes in secondary stage increases in the ovary, resulting in a change in coloration of the gonad. Oogonias, primary oocytes, secondary oocytes and follicular cells were histologically described and measured. In female's ovaries of U. rapax the modifications observed in the oocytes during the process of gonad maturation are similar to descriptions of gonads of other females of brachyuran crustaceans. The similarities are specially found in the morphological changes in the reproductive cells, and also in the presence and arrange of follicle cells during the process of ovary maturation. When external morphological characteristics of the gonads were compared to histological descriptions, it was possible to observe modifications that characterize the process in different developmental stages throughout the ovarian cycle and, consequently, the macroscopic classification of gonad stages agree with the modifications of the reproductive cells.

the subfamily Goneplacinae, which combines the subfamilies Goneplacinae
MacLeay, 1838 and Carcinoplacinae H. Milne Edwards, 1852. Most of the 66
species of Goneplacinae sensu stricto that are listed herein inhabit relatively deep
water and are infrequently collected. The subfamily Goneplacinae sensu stricto
now consists of 17 genera of which 10 are being described as new: Carcinoplax
H. Milne Edwards, 1852, with 18 species of which four are new; Entricoplax
n. gen., monotypic; Exopheticus n. gen., with two species; Goneplacoides n. gen.,
monotypic; Goneplax Leach, 1814, with four species; Hadroplax n. gen.,
monotypic; Menoplax n. gen., monotypic; Microgoneplax n. gen., with five
species of which four are new; Neogoneplax n. gen., with three species of which
two are new; Neommatocarcinus Takeda & Miyake, 1969, monotypic; Notonyx
A. Milne-Edwards, 1873, with three species; Ommatocarcinus White, 1852,
with four species; Paragoneplax n. gen., monotypic; Psopheticus Wood-Mason,
1892, with four species; Pycnoplax n. gen., with five species of which one is
new; Singhaplax Serène & Soh, 1976, with seven species of which four are new;
and Thyraplax n. gen., with five species of which three are new. All goneplacine
genera are exclusive to the Indo-West Pacific region (plus contiguous temperate
areas) except Goneplax, which is so far known mostly from the Atlantic and
Mediterranean regions. Four nominal species described by other authors were
found to be junior subjective synonyms for other species: Carcinoplax verdensis
Rathbun, 1914 and C. polita Guinot, 1989 synonymous of C. specularis Rathbun,

AB  - The aim of the present work conducted at the Refugio de Vida Silvestre Bahia Samborombon, Argentina, is to analyse the most relevant aspects of the life cycles of Chasmagnathus granulatus and Uca uruguayensis: their abundance, size distribution and sex ratio in order to be used for make management purposes. A total of 1200 individuals of U. uruguayensis (megalopae, juveniles and adults) and 957 individuals of C. granulatus (juveniles and adults) were collected from March 2001 to February 2003. U. uruguayensis had a maximun density of 42 ind./m(2) in February 2003, while the maximun density of C. granulatus was 52 ind./m(2) in June 2001. Minimun density was zero individual for both species in July 2002. Each environmental factor sampled (temperature of water, salinity and pH) was correlated with the abundance of each species by Pearson's linear correlation analysis. Sex ratio did not significantly differ from the expected Mendelian ratio, except for U. uruguayensis in December 2002 (male-biassed) and C. granulatus in June and December 2001, April 2002 and February 2003 (female-biassed). Ovigerous females of U. uruguayensis and C. granulatus were found during the summer.

AB  - The Deepwater Horizon accident in the Gulf of Mexico resulted in a sustained release of crude oil, and weathered oil was reported to have washed onto shorelines and marshes along the Gulf coast. One strategy to minimize effects of tarballs, slicks, and oil sheen, and subsequent risk to nearshore ecosystem resources was to use oil dispersants (primarily Corexit (R) 9500) at offshore surface and deepwater locations. Data have been generated reporting how Corexit 9500 and other dispersants may alter the acute toxicity of crude oil (Louisiana sweet crude) to marine organisms. However, it remains unknown how oil dispersants may influence bioaccumulation of petroleum hydrocarbons in nearshore crustaceans. We compare bioaccumulation of petroleum hydrocarbons in fiddler crabs (Uca minax) from exposures to the water accommodated fraction (WAF) of weathered Mississippi Canyon 252 oil (similar to 30 d post spill) and chemically-enhanced WAF when mixed with Corexit (R) EC9500A. Whole body total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) concentrations were greater than background for both treatments after 6 h of exposure and reached steady state at 96 h. The modeled TPH uptake rate was greater for crabs in the oil only treatment (k(u) = 2.51 mL/g/h vs. 0.76 mL/g/h). Furthermore, during the uptake phase TPH patterns in tissues varied between oil only and oil+dispersant treatments. Steady state bioaccumulation factors (BAFs) were 19.0 mL/g and 14.1 mL/g for the oil only and oil+Corexit treatments, respectively. These results suggest that the toxicokinetic mechanisms of oil may be dependent on oil dispersion (e.g., smaller droplet sizes). The results also indicate that multiple processes and functional roles of species should be considered for understanding how dispersants influence bioavailability of petroleum hydrocarbons.

AB  - The benthic community structure of the Colorado River delta, Mexico, was studied by digging cores in six points along a line perpendicular to the coastline. Three communities were found. The external community is influenced by human activities, but the community indexes are similar to others reported in the literature for equivalent areas. The middle community has the highest density and biomass in the area, apparently because of bioturbation created by the crab Uca princeps. The internal community is poor in density and biomass, possibly because of the instability caused by erosion related to the tide flux.

AB  - Macro-benthic faunal communities were compared between non-vegetation mudflat and Aegiceras corniculatum mangroves with different ages in Jiulongjiang Estuary, China. Faunal species number was highest in the mature mangrove and was higher in mangroves than in the mudflat, as snails and some crustaceans species were only collected in mangroves. The 5-year-old mangrove had the highest infaunal abundance and crustacean biomass. Snails had more abundance in the young mangroves. Uca arcuata was the dominant crab species in the non-vegetation mudflat and 5-year-old mangrove. Mangrove vegetation and sediment characteristics analyses indicated different habitats due to A. corniculatum mangrove restoration. However, overall poor correlations between faunal assemblage and sediment properties indicated that sediment properties were not the major factors influencing faunal distribution.

AB  - Distribution properties of macro-benthic faunal communities were compared among rehabilitated Kandelia candel forests of different ages in Jiulongjiang Estuary, China. From July 2005 to April 2006, seasonal surveys were conducted within four representative forests - K4, K7, K19 and K43, with ages of 4, 7, 19 and 43 years, respectively. Two non-vegetated flats (NF1 and NF2) were set as the references. Numbers of faunal species in rehabilitated forests were higher than NF1 and NF2, while younger forests (K4 and K7) generally had more macro-benthic fauna species than older ones (K19 and K43). Among the total 24 species recorded, Uca arcuata, Metaplax elegans, Phascolosoma esculenta and Littoraria melanostoma were dominant. Macro-benthic faunal community structures were different among the four rehabilitated K. candel forests. The dominant species in younger forests was M. elegans, while U. arcuata had a higher abundance than M. elegans in non-vegetation flats and older forests. Gastropods were abundant in younger forests. Distribution properties of dominant species differed among rehabilitated K. candel forests. U. arcuata had the largest density in nonvegetated flats, and was infrequent in younger forests. M. elegans had high abundances in younger forests. High abundance of P. esculenta was found in older forests, while L. melanostoma was more abundant in younger forests. Since both macro-benthic faunal community and vegetation were similar in K19 and K43, rehabilitated K. candel mangrove was considered steady 19 years after being planted. That is, in the case of macro-benthic fauna and vegetation, a K. candel mangrove may evolve to a mature state at a stand age of about 20 years. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Prevalence of certain celestial and terrestrial cues was tested in the zonal recovery behavior and orientation of the fiddler crab Uca cumulanta. Experiments were conducted in the field bordering a mangrove forest on the eastern Venezuelan coast. Uca cumulanta exhibited zonal recovery behavior based on different orientational references, including celestial cues (sun and polarized sky light) and terrestrial cues (landscape vision and substrate slope). Sun azimuth orientation was time- compensated. Apparent solar position and polarized sunlight pattern were celestial cues which, as tested, prevailed over landscape references and beach slope-terrestrial cues-in cueing the direction of the orientation response shown by crabs.

AB  - Behavioral responses of the fiddler crab Uca cumulanta to flat geometric shapes mimicking natural objects were measured in a circular arena by using zonal recovery as a behavioral measurement. Crabs were tested either in presence or absence of odors from two common predator species, the blue crab Callinectes sapidus, and the pufferfish Sphoeroides testudineus. The study tested the hypothesis that U. cumulanta have different behavioral responses to visual cues in the presence of chemical cues associated with predators. Escape direction tests demonstrated that U. cumulanta is able to show zonal recovery behavior based upon astronomical references. When tested in water lacking predator odor, crabs failed to exhibit a consistent orientation if a single silhouette target was interposed in the landward direction. However, when animals were tested in different predator odor concentrations, an orientation response was obtained at 10 and 20 g/liter/hr blue crab odor and 10 g/liter/hr pufferfish odor, demonstrating U. cumulanta ability to detect the potential presence of its natural predators by this odor. Thus, the hypothesis was supported, and the results suggest that behavioral responses to chemical and visual cues are involved in predator avoidance.

AB  - Larval release by adult fiddler crabs occurs during the ebbing tides, but its timing relative to the day-night and tidal amplitude cycles depends upon tidal form (e.g., shows phenotypical plasticity). Crabs (Uca thayeri ) from Florida's East Coast are exposed to semidiurnal tides and release their larvae at night, whereas crabs from Florida's West Coast exposed to mixed tides release their larvae during the afternoon. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the larvae could hatch at times other than those correlated with the tidal form at their location. Clusters of eggs at similar stages of development, 24-72 h in advance of release, were reciprocally transferred between females from each coast. Release of both the transferred larvae and maternal clutch occurred synchronously, and at the time dictated by the female's tidal regime. These results suggest that larvae are phenotypically plastic with respect to hatching time and can either delay (West coast) or advance (East coast) their response to release signals from females.

AB  - In fiddler crabs, larval release typically occurs at flood tide or shortly thereafter. The larvae are then transported by tidal currents out of the adult habitat, toward deeper “nursery” areas. When eggs are removed from a female a few hours before larval release is scheduled, they still hatch at high tide though the rhythm is less precisely synchronized with the tides. These findings suggest that both the female and her clutch have a tidal rhythm and that both play a role in the timing of the hatching and release process. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the timing of the rhythm in fiddler crab larvae was phenotypically plastic, that is, could be altered by signals from the female. To find out, eggs scheduled to hatch with 24-48 h were reciprocally transferred between ovigerous crabs (Uca thayeri Rathbun) whose clutches would hatch on the same day. Exchanges were made between females from Florida’s East coast, that release their larvae during nocturnal high tides, and females from Florida’s West coast, that release their larvae during the afternoon high tides. The data show that females released both the transplanted larvae and their own larvae at the same time, and on a temporal schedule appropriate to the females’ coastal location. These results indicate that the larvae are phenotypically plastic, and will respond to signals from females to hatch several hours earlier (East coast larvae) or later (West coast larvae) than expected.

AB  - Many intertidal and shallow water crabs have strong reproductive cycles and migratory larvae. Females release larvae near the time of high water of the larger amplitude nocturnal tides during the semilunar or lunar cycles. Newly hatched larvae move quickly at night toward and into the sea where, weeks later, they develop to megalopae that then ride nocturnal flood tides inshore and up estuaries to settle in adult habitats. It was first thought that crabs might time larval release so that larvae will become megalopae when they can ride the larger amplitude spring flood tides to adult habitats. This idea was rejected when it was found that were was no change in the timing of hatching during the breeding season by several estuarine species that would compensate for the decrease in the larval development period as the water temperature increased. In addition, megalopae moved up-stream at night but not on the largest spring flood tides. Attention shifted to the possible value to larvae of leaving the estuary quickly to avoid high temperatures, low salinities or stranding. This idea was not supported when it was found that species on open coasts exhibit the same reproductive patterns as do estuarine species. Alternatively, by moving quickly to the ocean at night larvae may best escape visual planktivorous fishes that are especially abundant in shallow areas. This predator avoidance hypothesis has been broadly supported: species with larvae that are cryptic, spiny and better protected from predation lack both strong reproductive cycles and larval migration. The mechanisms that promote precise reproductive timing have been little studied. evidence is presented that female fiddler crabs may adjust the timing of fertilization to compensate for variation in incubation temperatures that would otherwise induce timing errors. However, crabs on colder coasts, as in Chile, apparently do not exhibit biweekly or monthly cycles of larval release. The consequences of this for adults and larvae have vet to be explored.

AB  - Most semiterrestrial, intertidal and shallow subtidal brachyuran crabs that live in tropical and warm temperate estuaries, bays and protected coasts world-wide release their planktonic larvae near the times of nocturnal high tides on the larger amplitude tides in the biweekly or monthly cycles of tidal amplitude. Crab larvae usually emigrate quickly to the sea where they develop to return as postlarvae to settle in habitats suitable for their survival. Predators of larvae are more abundant where larvae are released than where they develop, suggesting that this migration from estuaries to the sea reduces predation on larvae. Crabs with larvae that are relatively well-protected by spines and cryptic colors do not emigrate and often lack strong reproductive cycles, lending support to this explanation. Adults control the timing of the release of larvae with respect to the biweekly and monthly cycles of tidal amplitude by controlling when they court and mate and females control when development begins by controlling when they ovulate and allow their eggs to be fertilized by stored sperm. By changing the time they breed, fiddler crabs (Uca terpsichores) compensate for the effects of spatial and temporal variation in incubation temperature on development rates so that embryos are ready to hatch at the appropriate time. Control of the diel and tidal timing of hatching and of release of larvae varies with where adults live. Females of the more terrestrial species often move from protected incubation sites, sometimes far from water, and they largely control the precise time, both, of hatching and of release of larvae. Females of intertidal species also may influence when embryos begin to hatch. Upon hatching, a chemical cue is released that stimulates the female to pump her abdomen, causing rapid hatching and release of all larvae in her clutch. Embryos, rather than females, largely control hatching in subtidal species, perhaps because females incubate their eggs where they release their larvae. Topics for further study include the mechanism whereby adults regulate the timing of breeding, the mechanisms by which females control development rates of embryos, the nature of communication between females and embryos that leads to precise and synchronous hatching by the number (often thousands) of embryos in a clutch, and the causes of selection for such precision. The timing of hatching and of release of larvae by cold-temperate, Arctic, and Antarctic species and by fully terrestrial and freshwater tropical species has received little attention.

AB  - Courting male fiddler crabs, Uca terpsichores, construct unusually large sand hoods at the entrances to their burrows to which they attract females for mating. Females sequentially visit several courting males before they stay with one and mate in his burrow, and they preferentially approach burrows with hoods. While moving between burrows, crabs are at risk of predation by birds and they sometimes run to objects that provide temporary cover. Thus, the female preference for burrows with hoods may help females to avoid predators. Could selection for predator avoidance produce a directional preference for especially large hoods? To examine this possibility, we made multiple replicas of two kinds of hood models with exaggerated dimensions (super models and wall models) and a single model with average dimensions (average models). Super models were four standard deviations taller and two standard deviations wider than average-size natural hoods. Wall models were of average height but near the maximum width of natural hoods; when males 'overbuild', they construct wall-like hoods. We replaced males' hoods with these models and measured their effects on male attractiveness. Males with exaggerated models neither encountered nor attracted more females than did males with average models or natural hoods. Females did not show a directional preference for larger hoods. The attractiveness of hoods may plateau with increasing size because discrimination between average and larger hoods may result in fatal hesitation, preventing the evolution of a directional preference for an exaggerated form of this courtship signal. Males build hoods from pure sand, so males may build unusually large hoods because they are more durable, not because they are better signals.

AB  - Courting male fiddler crabs Uca musica sometimes build hoods at the entrances of their burrows to which females come for mating. Females differentially orient to burrows with hoods and thereby show a mate preference for hood builders. Here we describe how this mode of sexual selection may affect hood design and building. Larger males built generally larger but not higher hoods. Small males may build relatively high hoods so that they will be conspicuous to females of all sizes and construction or other costs may limit hood height. Most males built only one hood each biweekly reproductive cycle, typically on a day that many females chose mates, and they finished construction before females began mate searching. Both patterns fit predictions based on applying ideal free theory to the timing of sexual signaling. Sexual selection may favor more frequent hood building but the timing of hood building appears to be optimal.

AB  - Males of the fiddler crab Uca musica sometimes build sand hoods at the entrances of their burrows, to which they attract females for mating with claw waving and other displays. Females significantly more often approached males with hoods than males without hoods, but once at a burrow, they were just as likely to stay and mate whether the male had a hood or not. To determine how hoods affect male attractiveness, we conducted experiments that controlled for other differences in courtship behavior between builders and nonbuilders; we removed hood builders' hoods and we added hood models to nonbuilders' burrows. We then measured the attractiveness of hood builders and nonbuilders with and without hoods. Neither manipulation measurably affected male courtship behavior. The presence of a hood did not increase male-female encounter rates, suggesting that hoods do not attract distant females into a male's courtship range. However, once a male courted a female, she was significantly more likely to approach if he had a real or model hood. We obtained direct evidence that females orient to hoods by replacing them with hood models positioned about 3 cm away from the openings to males' burrows. Females approached the models, not the courting males, about 27% of the time. We conclude that hood building is sexually selected because courted females differentially approach hoods, not because hoods attract distant females and not because females prefer to mate with hood builders.

AB  - Male fiddler crabs Uca musica sometimes build sand hoods and male Uca beebei sometimes build mud pillars next to their burrows to which they attract females for mating. Mate- searching females preferentially approach these structures and subsequently mate with structure builders. Here we show that the preference for structures is not species-specific and argue that it may not have evolved for mate choice. When not near burrows, many species of fiddler crabs approach and temporarily hide near objects, suggesting that hoods and pillars may attract females because they elicit this general predator- avoidance behavior. To test this sensory trap hypothesis we individually released female U. musica, U. beebei and Uca stenodactylus, a non-builder, in the center of a circular array of empty burrows to which we added hoods and pillars and then moved a model predator toward the females. All species ran to structures to escape the predator and the two builders preferred hoods. Next, we put hood replicas on male U. beebei burrows and pillar replicas on male U. musica burrows. When courted, females of both species preferentially approached hoods as they did when chased with a predator. However, males of both species with hoods did not have higher mating rates than males with pillars perhaps because hoods block more of a male's visual field so he sees and courts fewer females. Sexual selection may often favor male signals that attract females because they facilitate general orientation or navigation mechanisms that reduce predation risk in many contexts, including during mate search.

AB  - Courting male fiddler crabs, Uca musica, sometimes build sand hoods at the entrances of their burrows to which they attract females for mating. On average, females visit 17 males in as many minutes before they choose a mate, and they preferentially visit males with hoods. When moving between burrows, fiddler crabs of both sexes sometimes approach and temporarily hide against objects on the surface. Hence, mate-searching females may approach hoods because they resemble (mimic) other objects that crabs approach to reduce their predation risk. We conducted two experiments to test this sensory trap hypothesis. First, we determined whether sexually receptive and nonreceptive female U. musica and nonreceptive female U. stenodactylus, a species that does not build structures, spontaneously approach hoods (replicas), stones, pieces of wood and shells. As predicted by the sensory trap hypothesis, both species, irrespective of sexual receptivity, approached these objects and neither preferred hoods. Second, to determine whether female U. musica show a preference for hoods when they search for a mate, we recorded the frequency with which females approached males with natural hoods, hood replicas, wood, stones and shells. Again as expected, females approached males with these different structures at the same rates. We conclude that hoods are effective mimics of objects that females approach for safety whether they are searching for a mate or not. Males benefit by using this sensory trap because hoods make them more attractive, and receptive females may benefit when they approach hoods because they reduce their mate-search risk.

AB  - Male fiddler crabs have one greatly enlarged claw that they wave to attract females for mating and that they use as a weapon to fight other males. Longer claws probably are more effective visual signals and attractive to females. Male fiddlers increase the length of their large claw by lengthening their dactyl (movable finger) and polex (fixed finger) disproportionately relative to the size of their manus, which contains the closing muscle. Consequently, as males grow, the closing force they deliver at the tip of their claw decreases relative to their size. J. Levinton and colleagues have called this the paradox of the weakening combatant: beauty begets weakness. We studied claw morphology and fighting in two tropical fiddler crabs Uca beebei and Uca terpsichores and found a resolution to this paradox. When fighting males contracted their intertwined claws the forces were delivered not at the tips of the claws but at tubercles on the inner margins of the dactyl and polex. These tubercles contacted the inner and outer surfaces of the manus and often left small puncture wounds providing a record of where the forces were delivered. As claws grow these tubercles remain relatively close to the apex of the gape so that the mechanical advantage governing the delivery of forces at these points stays constant or decreases only slightly relative to claw length. Consequently the closing force at these tubercles, the product of the mechanical advantage and the cross-sectional area of the closer muscle, increased much more rapidly with male size than did the forces at the tip of the claw. Through differential growth of the dactyl and polex distal to the tubercles where the forces of contraction are applied, male fiddler crabs make large claws that are both beautiful and powerful weapons.

AB  - We saw 79 predatory interactions between a new species of monostiliferous, suctorial hoplonemertean and the fiddler crabs Uca musica (77 cases) and U. stenodactylus (2 cases). At an intertidal sand bar in the Pacific entrance of the Panama Canal, worms ate about 0.1% of the adult crab population per day. The mode of attack and the spatial and temporal distributions of interactions suggest the worm is an ambush predator. When struck by a worm's sticky, mucous-covered proboscis, crabs produced copious foam from their buccal area. Mucous-laden crabs that escaped, again foamed indicating that the foam may counteract the mucus. If the attack led to a kill, the struggling crab soon became quiescent, as is typical in other nemertean-prey interactions. The worm inverted its proboscis, found ingress to the crab's body and fed. Crabs escaped by autotomizing appendages entwined by the proboscis, by forcefully pulling away and by remaining quiescent, then moving away when the worm inverted its proboscis and before it entered the crab. Immobility, a response to visual predators, may falsely indicate paralysis to the worm and cause it to invert its proboscis, thereby providing the crab with an opportunity to escape. This predator-prey interaction seems to incorporate generalized predator tactics and fortuitous prey defenses that give worms and crabs about an even chance of success.

AB  - Most estuarine crab larvae emigrate from estuaries soon after they hatch. develop to the postlarval stage in the coastal ocean and then immigrate to estuaries and settle in adult habitats. We studied the patterns and mechanisms of immigration by postlarvae of 9 crab taxa in the small, high-salinity North Inlet estuary (South Carolina, USA) by sampling the plankton daily for 32 d over the length of the estuary. A concurrent study of larval production and flux showed that all taxa rapidly emigrate, thereby establishing empirically the importance of immigration in this estuary and giving us the rare opportunity to compare the relative species abundance of emigrating larvae and immigrating postlarvae. Contrary to the popular view that planktonic development in the sea uncouples larval recruitment from production, the community composition of emigrants and immigrants were comparable. Postlarvae immigrated at night and primarily on large amplitude flood tides. We show that this pattern is common in other estuaries and we argue that it reduces fish predation on immigrating postlarvae. Saltatory, up-estuary immigration was evident in 5 species that moved from the lower to the upper estuary (4 km) in 1 to 3 d. Although immigration rates have not been measured directly in other estuaries, a study of postlarval settlement in Mobile Bay suggests that rates may vary geographically in relation to variation in the tidal regime.

AB  - Predation on adults or young in the intertidal zone may vary predictably with the daylight, tidal height and tidal amplitude cycles and favor reproductive timing for predator avoidance. A novel pattern in the reproductive cycle of the fiddler crab Uca terpsichores supports this idea. Fiddler crab larvae are vulnerable to predation by diurnally feeding planktivorous fish that abound in shallow habitats where adults live. Estuarine fiddler crabs usually release larvae at night near the time of the evening high tides on the few consecutive days every two weeks with larger amplitude nocturnal ebb tides. Consequently, newly released larvae move rapidly seaward on ebbing tides under the cover of darkness and thus avoid falling prey to diurnal planktivors. Daily monitoring for 20 months of the intensity of courtship by U. terpsichores, which lives on protected sand beaches in the tropical Eastern Pacific, shows they have a typical biweekly courtship and mating cycle but with two modes split by a day when reproductive activity is greatly reduced. Given that embryonic development takes about two weeks, this mid-day pause predicts a decline in larval release two weeks later on the days with crepuscular high tides. Plankton sampling showed that larvae are released throughout the night up until dawn. As predicted, there was a decline in the density of newly hatched larvae on days with twilight high tides and also on days with moonlit high tides. Avoiding light-dependent visual predators at the time of larval release is paramount for this species. Apparently less important is extensive seaward dispersal at night perhaps because this species lives relatively close to deeper, safer waters.

AB  - Comparative ethological studies of closely related species can place into clear perspective the functions of behavioral traits as species diverge and adapt to different environments. In this paper we contrast the reproductive behavior of species within two crustacean groups: the mantis shrimps (stomatopods) and the fiddler crabs (genus Uca). For the stomatopods, we identify probable selective relationships between features of species' ecology and their mating systems. Population density, the kind and availability of shelters in which these shrimps live, the intensity of predation and spawning cycles all play important roles in molding reproductive behavior in this group. Associations between the ecology and mating systems of fiddler crabs have been discussed recently elsewhere. Here we focus on a comparative analysis of sexual communication in these crabs. A study of competitive courtship signaling and mate choice in the fiddler crab Uca beebei has shown that certain male courtship signals are highly attractive probably because they exploit female sensory-response systems that have been molded by selection for escape from predators. Interspecific comparison of male courtship displays and the responses of females to these displays suggest that sensory exploitation may play an important role in the evolution of sexual signals in the genus. Comparative studies have advanced our understanding of how natural and sexual selection affect the reproductive behavior of both stomatopods and fiddler crabs.

AB  - Males of the fiddler crab Uca beebei defend, court from and attract females to burrows in intertidal mud flats. Females sequentially enter and leave several male burrows before they stay in one, mate and breed. This reproductive pattern is common among fiddler crabs and suggests that males may compete for females by competing for high-quality breeding sites and females may choose mates based on burrow quality. These ideas were tested for U. beebei by comparing structural features of (1) male and female burrows and (2) the male burrows females entered and left and those in which they mated. Male burrows had narrower openings and shafts than female burrows, but neither these nor 10 other burrow features differed between the male burrows females left and those in which they mated. Thus, there was no evidence of resource-defence mating in U. beebei. This pattern of mating behaviour may be rare in the genus because burrows suitable for breeding generally may be abundant and available to both sexes. Male fiddler crabs may compete for burrows due to their value for post-copulatory mate guarding and females may choose mates on the basis of courtship displays, not the quality of burrows for breeding.

AB  - We report the cloning and analysis of ecdysteroid receptor (UpEcR) and retinoid-X receptor (UpRXR) cDNA homologs from the fiddler crab Uca pugilator. The deduced amino acid sequence of this crustacean EcR most closely resembles the insect EcRs within the DNA binding and ligand binding: domains (LBDs). For UpRXR, the DNA binding domain (DBD) shares greatest identity to the insect USPs. The ligand binding domain, however, is closer to vertebrate RXRs but may have a nonfunctional AF-2 domain. Probes derived from these clones were used to examine transcript levels in blastemas during early limb regeneration. Both UpEcR and UpRXR transcripts were detected in low amounts 1 day after limb loss, but increased during the next 4 days. Immersion of crabs in sea water containing all-trans retinoic acid increased the steady state concentrations of UpRXR transcript and altered the pattern of circulating ecdpsteroids. These effects correlate with the disruptive effects of retinoic acid on blastemal differentiation observed in earlier studies.

AB  - In the fiddler crab, Uca pugilator, we have investigated the temporal expression of receptors in various tissues using probes that encode Uca ecdysteroid receptor (UpEcR) and retinoid-X-receptor (UpRXR) gene homologs. During molt stages C-4 through D1-4, UpEcR and UpRXR transcripts are expressed in regenerating limb buds, gills, eyestalks, hypodermis, hepatopancreas, muscle from nonregenerating walking legs, and the large cheliped. Some of these tissues have not previously been recognized as ecdysteroid-target tissues. Levels of ecdysteroids in the hemolymph fluctuate significantly during the molt cycle of U. pugilator. The variation in steady-state concentrations of UpEcR transcripts in tissues from C-4 to D1-4 implies molt cycle-related differences in the potential of these tissues to respond to changing titers of ecdysteroids in the hemolymph. In singly autotomized crabs, highest concentrations of UpEcR transcript in some tissues did not coincide with the highest levels of circulating ecdysteroids, suggesting that UpEcR expression in these tissues is not dependent on high ecdysteroid titers and may be induced by low or rising concentrations of ecdysteroids. UpEcR and UpRXR genes were expressed simultaneously in tissues, supporting the possibility of heterodimerization for EcR and RXR in vivo. In some tissues, however, levels of transcripts differed, suggesting other possible receptor interactions. Moreover, UpEcR expression in tissues from multiply autotomized crabs differed from the expression patterns in tissues from singly autotomized crabs.

AB  - The pinching forces of crustaceans are in many respects analogous to the biting forces of vertebrates. We examined the effects of body size and chelae size and shape, on the closing forces of the fiddler crab, Uca pugilator, and the crayfish, Procambarus clarkii. We hypothesized that the allometric relationships would be similar among species, and comparable to those reported for other decapod crustaceans. We further hypothesized that the scaling of the closing forces of crustaceans, with respect to body size and with the geometry of the pinching or biting structures, would be similar to that of vertebrates. We found that pinching forces increased with body mass, claw dimensions, and claw mass in U. pugilator, but only with claw height and claw mass in P. clarkii. Contraction time increased with body mass for both species combined, whereas contraction speed decreased. Pooled data for these and 17 other species of decapod crustacean revealed a positive correlation between the pinching force and body mass with a scaling exponent of 0.71. These data are remarkably comparable to the values on closing forces of vertebrate jaws, with the pooled data having a scaling exponent of 0.58, slightly below the value of 0.67 predicted for geometric similarity. Maximum closing forces vary tremendously among both crustaceans and animals in general, with body size and food habits being among the most important determining factors.

AB  - In nitrogen-limited temperate marshes, increasing nitrogen availability via biological mechanisms such as N-2 fixation and organic matter mineralization may lead to elevated marsh plant growth and macroinvertebrate densities. A polysaccharide, alginate, known to enhance microbial activity was added to sediment in a salt marsh (GA, USA) and the responses of the smooth cordgrass, Spartina alterniflora, and densities of common macroinvertebrates with important roles in nutrient cycling and energy flow through detrital systems were examined. Plant characteristics and macroinvertebrate densities were measured over portions of two growing seasons between July 2007 and July 2008. Spartina alterniflora stem densities increased in the alginate treatment compared to controls after six weeks of exposure, and this difference was evident throughout the second growing season. Differences in plant heights emerged during the second growing season. Positive effects on Geukensia demissa densities occurred during both growing seasons, Littoraria irrorata densities were elevated relative to controls only in the second growing season, and no differences were observed for Uca pugnax. This potential for increased marsh productivity following carbon amendments may be useful in developing plans for salt marsh recovery.

AB  - Crab fecundity is widely known to vary proportionally to female size, but the female's nutritional state also has an important effect on egg production. This study evaluates intraspecific variability of reproductive output by monthly sampling Uca vocator populations from the Itapanhau, Indaia, and Itamambuca mangroves on the southeastern coast of Brazil. The presence of ovigerous crabs, their carapace width (CW) and their number of eggs were recorded. Additionally, the productivity of the mangroves and the content of organic matter of the sediments were analysed in order to estimate food availability in each locality. Size-specific fecundity relationships were obtained for each population and compared among the three populations. Ovigerous females from Itamambuca are the largest and their fecundities are also the highest among the populations studied. These results probably are associated with the favourable environmental conditions in Itamambuca, as this is a young mangrove with a high productivity level.

AB  - The population structure of U. vocator was investigated during a one-year period in three mangrove forests in southeast Brazil. The study specifically addressed comparisons on individual size;juvenile recruitment and sex-ratio. The structure of the mangrove forests, i.e. density, basal area, and diameter, and the physical properties of sediments, i.e. texture and organic matter contents, were also examined. A catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) technique was used to sample the crab populations using 15-min sampling periods by two people. Males always outnumbered females, probably due to ecological and behavioural attributes of these crabs. The median size of fiddler crabs differed among the sampled populations. The mangroves at Indaia and Itamambuca showed higher productivity than those at Itapanhau, where oil spills impacting the shore were reported. Marked differences were found regarding individual size, either their size at the onset of sexual maturity or their asymptotic size, suggesting that food availability may be favouring growth in the studied populations.

AB  - Differences in sorting of sediment grain-size during the feeding activity of fiddler crabs were investigated experimentally in four Uca species that have different numbers of spoon-tipped setae on the second maxillipeds. Uca leptodactylus had the highest number of spoon-tipped setae, followed by Uca rapax and Uca thayeri; whereas Uca vocator had no setae of this type. The crabs were allowed to feed for 48 h, in containers filled with three types of sediments with different particle-size composition. The feeding pellets formed in each type of sediment were collected, and the proportion of each granulometric fraction was compared with the substrate in the container. The diameters of the sediment particles found in the crab stomachs were measured and compared among the species and the types of sediments. The granulometry of the feeding pellets in each substrate was similar among the species. The size of particles ingested by fiddler crabs reflected the granulometric composition of the experimental substrate. Only U. leptodactylus ingested the smallest grains in coarser sediments. Therefore, the variation in the number of spoon-tipped setae on the second maxilliped seems not to affect the ability of fiddler crabs to manipulate and sort different particle sizes during feeding.

AB  - Fiddler crabs are deposit feeders, and use the setae on their mouth appendages to manipulate sediment particles to extract food. The number of spoon-tipped setae on the second maxilliped is frequently related to the distribution of fiddler crabs on estuarine sediments, but no study has compared the morphological diversity of these setae among multiple fiddler crab species. Here, we describe and classify the setae of the second maxillipeds of the nine Uca spp. known from the Brazilian coast. The second maxilliped of each species was examined by scanning electron microscopy. Six types of setae (five papposerrate, and one pappose) were described on the meropodite of the second maxilliped. Among the papposerrate setae, one type had a spoon-like tip, and the morphology of this type, especially the degree of curvature, differed between species. Members of Uca leptodactylus, U. uruguayensis, and U. maracoani had highly concave spoon-tipped setae. In U. rapax and U. cumulanta, the setal tip was moderately curved, while in U. thayeri, U. burgersi, and U. mordax, this curvature was slight. At the other extreme, the meropodite of the second maxilliped of U. vocator lacked setae altogether. This is the first study that describes differences in the degree of curvature of spoon-tipped setae in fiddler crabs. This trait may be strongly related to the distribution of these fiddler crabs on different estuarine substrates.

AB  - The Mira estuary is a narrow entrenched pristine estuary of the Ria type, about 30 km long. It comprises an area of 285 ha of salt marsh, of which 250 ha have been proposed for reclamation for aquaculture. Dredging, village and recreation development menace the yet undisturbed estuarine ecosystem. To assess the biological importance of this wetland, a multidisciplinary study was conducted in a part of the salt marsh, considered as being representative of the whole area. Halophytic vegetation covering 75% of the total salt marsh site is dominated by Spartina maritima (28% of total vegetation area). Total primary production attains 63,766 kg/yr (dw). A net export of 1541 kg/yr of COM to the relatively oligotrophic adjacent waters was also found. Insects and birds are described for the first time in the saltmarsh. Macrobenthic communities are dominated by Hediste diversicolor, Nepthys caeca and Scrobicularia plana. The fiddler crab Uca tangeri attains here its north distribution limit. The mud flats and creeks associated with the salt marsh act as a nursery for 40.8% of the fish species present. The food web is dominated by detritivorous species like the grey mullets. The results obtained in this study support the need for an effective conservation of this area.

AB  - A population of the fiddler crab Uca rapox (Smith, 1870) found in Itaipu Lagoon, southeast Brazil, was sampled monthly from July 2006 to June 200, in order to study population and reproductive features. The sex ratio of the population was statistically different from the expected (1 :1) in almost every month, with a predominance of males. The reproductive cycle and the recruitment of juveniles were continuous, with two peaks. The fecundity ranged front 1.110 to 13.189 eggs (4.984 +/- 2.493.8), not differing statistically among seasons. In contrast, the relative fecundity (F') and the reproductive intensity index (RII) were highest in the summer. Female size at the onset of sexual maturity was estimated as 6.1 mm and egg diameter ranged from 0.20 to 0.28 mm. The anthropogenic impact on the environment of Itaipu Lagoon probably had adverse effects on the local U. rapax population, as inferred by its low fecundity rates, early maturation age and biased sex ratio.

AB  - The population dynamics and secondary production of the fiddler crab Uca rapax Smith, 1870 in the Itaipu Lagoon (Southeast Brazil) were studied. Samples were taken monthly over a period of 12 months, in order to test latitudinal gradient predictions about secondary production and P/B ratio. Males and females showed the same growth rates (K = 2.083) and reached the same asymptotic size (15.57 mm). However, females showed higher total (Z = 3.20) and annual mortality (A = 0.96 ind.year(-1)) than males (Z = 1.89; A = 0.85 ind.year(-1)). Recruitment occurred in all months, except in June, 2007. Secondary production was estimated in 113.4 g AFDW.m(-2).year(-1) and the production to biomass ratio (P/B) was 15.09. The production and P/B ratio estimated in the present study did not agree with the latitudinal gradient literature predictions.

AB  - The population biology of Uca thayeri was studied in a subtropical mangrove in Ubatuba, State of Sao Paulo, Brazil. Two sampling techniques were used: transect sampling and catch- per-unit-effort. Size frequency distribution, sex-ratio, and reproductive period were analysed. For juvenile crabs (CW < 4.6 mm), the transect procedure was most efficient, while ovigerous females were most collected during the capture effort. Males were most numerous in the transect technique, while in the catch-per-unit-effort there was no difference between sexes. The species showed a different size frequency distribution for each sampling procedure. The reproduction of U. thayeri is seasonal, being more pronounced in the warmer months of the year. However, juveniles occurred all over the year, although more numerous in the colder months. The success of the species in reproductive activity and the constant colonization of the area can be attributed to the availability of food resources and differential occupation of the habitat by ovigerous females.

AB  - Ovigerous females of Uca thayeri and U. uruguayensis were used to achieve and compare their reproductive pattern. The females mean size was 6.6 +/- 0.8mm for U. uruguayensis and 17.3 +/- 4.4mm for U. thaveri. The mean fecundity obtainedfor U. uruguayensis was 1883 +/- 490 eggs (N = 27) andfor U. thayeri was 31068 +/- 11186 eggs (N = 31). The differences observed in reproductive pattern of U. thayeri and U. uruguayensis suggest an adaptive strategy by each species: U. thayeri presented seasonal reproduction with a pronounced intensity from January to March and higher fecundity, while U. uruguayensis reproduction was continuous all year round, but with lower fecundity.

AB  - We examined short-term differences in assemblage organization of surface-active arthropods from a restricted portion of a coastal dune ecosystem near Puerto Penasco, Sonora, Mexico. To test the hypothesis that soil moisture gradients influence organization, we established three, 32-m transects running westward from real or simulated shorelines of 1) an estuary terminus ("ester"), 2) a salt-water pond ("seep"), and 3) an intermediate dry desert site ("control"). Transect moisture gradients ranged, at the estero and seep sites respectively, from 15% and 11% to < 1%, while soil moisture at the control site was < 1% (mean values to 15cm depths). Four evenly spaced plots, each 3 x 7m, along each transect contained pitfall traps that captured arthropods continuously for eight (estero, seep), or six (control), 12-h periods. We trapped 558 arthropods comprising 50 species, excluding abundant ants of the genus Solenopsis. Rarefaction analysis for sample sizes of 80 gave expected species numbers, E(Sn), of 27 (estero), 21.5 (seep), and 18 (control) when the swamping effect of Uca latimanus (crabs which were dominant at the estero, absent elsewhere) was removed. Arthropods other than crabs were twice as abundant at the estero and four times as abundant at night, respectively, as they were at the other two sites and during the day. Carnivore:detritivore species ratios at the three sites were approximately 2:1 (estero) 1:1 (seep) and 1:2 (control). Evenness (modified Hill's E5) values without Uca were similar at all sites; however, high diversity (Hill's N2) values for the estero assemblage confirmed the presence of a small number of abundant species (carabid beetles, lycosid spiders) there. We found no significant correlation between percent plant cover and total densities or species richness of trapped arthropods. Measurements of beta-diversity (Sorensen's community coefficient) reinforced the uniqueness of the estero assemblage.

AB  - As a result of the parasitological examination of the crabs, Uca uruguayensis (Ocypodidae) and Chasmagnathus granulatus (Varunidae), third-stage larval nematodes belonging to the family Acuariidae and to the genus Ascarophis were found in the crabs' hemocoel, both free and embedded in host tissues. Larval nematodes are described and illustrated here. The presence of these larval nematodes in both crab species may be influenced by the similarity in the crabs' habitat and feeding behavior. Both species of burrowing crabs inhabit the upper intertidal zones and feed on sediments, and consequently, they have similar chances of coming into contact with eggs and infective larval nematodes deposited in the feces of birds and fish definitive hosts. Since the life cycles of the larval nematodes from U. uruguayensis and C. granulatus remain unknown and because the adult stage is undescribed, they cannot be assigned to a given genus or species. The validity of a previous record of Skrjabinoclava sp. in U. uruguayensis from Bahia Samborombom is also discussed.

AB  - Fiddler crabs of the genus Uca inhabit the marshes of the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico coasts. The present study examines the behavioral ecology, population demographics, and habitat utilization of Uca longisignalis, U. minax, and U. pugnax in four ecologically distinct habitats. Differences in male behavior, aspects of population biology, and food resources were examined in vegetated and non-vegetated (open) areas. While no significant differences were found in available food resources, males devoted significantly more time to reproductive behaviors in open areas. Further, while male/female ratios were skewed towards adult males occurring in the open areas, these same locations were devoid of juvenile crabs. Thus, it appears that the Uca species examined in the present study are using lekking as a reproductive strategy. Large-scale, random sampling was employed to test the ability of a single-event sample to predict population demography. Three marshes were sampled in June, July, and August. Adult fiddler crab densities, male/female ratios, gravid female carapace width, and the proportion of gravid females were similar within individual marshes. Further, fiddler crabs in all marshes exhibited a clumped distribution across all sampling periods. In contrast, the total number of fiddler crabs captured in each marsh varied significantly between sample periods. Therefore, it appears that useful information about population demographics can be obtained using a single-event sample if large sample size and robust collection methods are employed. Adult male fiddler crab carapace and cheliped morphology were examined to test whether selection was acting differentially on cheliped handedness. There were no significant differences in the proportion, mean size, or tested carapace characters of right- or left-handed crabs in the four sampled marshes. In the tested populations, it appears that the enlarged male cheliped occurs on either the right or left side in approximately equal proportions. The organic content and granulometry of marsh substratum and fiddler crab feeding pellets were examined to determine fiddler crab resource utilization. While substratum organic content was significantly different among the four marshes sampled, granulometry was similar. Feeding pellet analysis indicated that all three fiddler crab species utilize sediment resources in direct proportion to those available.

AB  - The reproductive behavior of Uca spp. has been extensively studied, especially the relationships between the dimorphically enlarged male claw and reproductive success. In contrast, little is known about the apparent congregations of adult males in marsh areas lacking vegetative cover where they engage in behaviors thought to attract mates. Similar congregations and displays in avian and mammalian species are termed 'leks.' In order to test the hypothesis that open-area assemblages of Lien spp. are functioning as leks, we examined the sex ratios, juvenile/adult ratios, and the percentage of time that adult males spend eliciting reproductive behaviors within open and vegetated areas of marsh habitats. Moreover, to evaluate whether differences in sediment-based food resources could explain open-area aggregations, we compared substratum organic content of open and vegetated areas of marsh habitats. Substrate was also examined to determine if grain size composition varied between open and vegetated areas and might preclude the construction of breeding burrows in vegetated areas of the marsh. Three species of Uea from four marsh habitats in biogeographically distinct regions of North America were sampled including Dauphin Island, Alabama, Hunting Island, South Carolina, Saris, Virginia, and Wallops Island, Virginia. Comparisons of male/female and juvenile/adult ratio means indicated that greater numbers of adult males occurred in open areas Of all marshes. In addition, adult males allocated significantly greater time to reproductive behaviors in open rather than in vegetatively covered areas across-all biogeographic regions and among all species. Food levels (sediment organic content) in open areas were equal to or less than sediment organic contents in vegetated areas in marsh habitats at Dauphin Island and Hunting Island, the two marshes where the variable was examined. Similarly, substratum granulometry analysis revealed no significant differences between open and vegetatively covered al eas of the marshes at Dauphin Island or Hunting Island that might influence choice of burrow location. Collectively, these observations support the hypothesis that lek behavior is an integral component of the productive repertoire in Uca spp. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The functional anatomy of the male reproductive system of Uca uruguayensis from Mar Chiquita lagoon, (37 degrees 45' S, 57 degrees 26' W), Argentina, was known only from optical microscopy. The present study describes the participation of vas deferens regions in spermatophore formation. A detailed description of the functional morphology of the different regions of the testicular lobes was carried out using both light and scanning electron microscopy. Spermatophore formation begins at the base of the testicular lobe. In most brachyuran species, the spermatophore starts formation when spermatozoa move from the collecting ducts of the testis to the vas deferens. However, in U. uruguayensis observations suggest that the formation of the spermatophore walls occurred in the terminal region of the testis, and that the spermatophore was formed at the junction of the testis and the vas deferens.

AB  - Structure of the male reproductive tract of Uca uruguayensis (Decapoda, Ocypodidae). The structure of the male reproductive tract was described in Uca uruguayensis Nobili, 1901, by using histological methods, scanning electron microscopy techniques, and stereoscopic observations of fresh material. The aim of this work was to establish the functional changes associated with sexual maturation. The morphology of the first (G1) and second (G2) pair of gonopods was described. The male reproductive tract consists of paired organs: testes, and tubular and convoluted vas deferens (VD) ending with a terminal ampoule (TA). The (VD) is composed of three parts: anterior (AVD), medial (MVD) and posterior (PVD). The AVD and MVD are lined by a single layer of cubical cells. The PVD epithelial cells are columnar with elongated nuclei. The terminal ampoule comprises four interconnecting chambers and is externally surrounded by connective tissue. The study of testes and vas deferens at different times along the year suggests that U. uruguayensis has a single and continuous reproductive season from December to March. The TA has not been described in other brachyurans and this structure is novel to Brachyura.

AB  - To clarify the relationship between the detritivore fiddler crab, Uca thayeri, and sediment bacteria, we quantified morphotype richness, abundance and evenness of these microorganisms inside the crabs' guts and in mangrove-associated sediments in Sisal, Mexico (21 degrees 9' N, 90 degrees 1' W) from July to September 2008. Increased bacterial richness and abundance were observed in mesocosm experiments when nutrients were added to the sediment or in the absence of fiddler crabs. Thus, crab disturbance seems to play a role in shaping the bacterial assemblage by reducing richness and abundance just as nutrient limitation does. Crabs can also play a second role by harboring a subset of bacterial morphotypes inside their gut. We exposed sterile sediment to fiddler crabs and found that viable cells were expelled from the crab's gut and proliferated in previously sterile substratum. The bacterial community is thus structured by the foraging behavior of fiddler crabs since it benefits some bacteria and restricts others. By agar plating we have obtained conservative results, yet the data suggest that the crab influences the bacterial assemblage in two ways by allowing inoculation of the sand from the gut and reducing bacteria diversity through disturbance when foraging on sediments.

AB  - In 2003, the National Research Council published Oil in the Sea III, a widely respected report that highlights priority areas for oil spill research. Cited as a "high priority" was the study of "chronic biological effects resulting from the persistence of medium and high molecular weight aromatic hydrocarbons and heterocyclic compounds and their degradation products in sediments..." In September 1969, the barge Florida ran aground in Buzzards Bay, Massachusetts and spilled 700,000 L of No. 2 fuel oil, which entered Wild Harbor. Recent work found that a substantial residue of the oil was still present 8 to 20 cm below the salt marsh surface. To examine the unknown lingering effects of petroleum exposure, I examined responses in organisms known to encounter buried oil, salt marsh fiddler crabs, Uca pugnax, salt marsh cord grass, Spartina alterniflora, and ribbed mussels, Geukensia demissa. Uca pugnax, which burrow into the sediments at depths of 5 to 25 cm, are chronically exposed to the spilled oil. Behavioral studies conducted with U. pugnax from Wild Harbor and a control site, Great Sippewissett marsh, found that crabs exposed to the oil avoided burrowing into oiled layers, suffered delayed escape responses, lowered feeding rates, and lower population densities. Spartina alterniflora grows in the oiled sediments and is chronically exposed to the spilled oil. Vegetation sampling in Wild Harbor and a control site, Great Sippewissett marsh, showed that above- and below-ground biomass decreased in oiled areas. Further, the decreased vegetation biomass has led to unconsolidated sediments, increased topographical variation and, ultimately, loss of salt marsh habitat. The ribbed mussel, Geukensia demissa, which live in sediments previously determined to be eroding at the creek bank, are exposed to the spilled oil. Studies of G. demissa from Wild Harbor and Great Sippewissett march, found that mussles exposed to the oil following exposure, exhibit slower growth rates, shorter mean shell lengths, lower condition indices, and decreased filtration rate. These results add new knowledge about long-term consequences of spilled oil, a component that should be included in assessments of oil-impacted areas and development of management plans designed to restore, rehabilitate, or replace impacted areas.

AB  - In September 1969, the Florida barge spilled 700,000 L of No. 2 fuel oil into the salt marsh sediments of Wild Harbor (Buzzards Bay, MA). Today the aboveground environment appears unaffected, but a substantial amount of moderately degraded petroleum still remains 8-20 cm below the surface. The salt marsh fiddler crabs, Uca pugnax, burrow into the sediments at depths of 5-25 cm, and are chronically exposed to the spilled oil. Behavioral studies conducted with U. pugnax from Wild Harbor and a control site, Great Sippewissett marsh, found that crabs exposed to the oil avoided burrowing into oiled layers, suffered delayed escape responses, lowered feeding rates, and achieved lower densities. The oil residues are therefore biologically active and affect U pugnax populations. Our results add new knowledge about long-term consequences of spilled oil, a dimension that should be included when assessing oil-impacted areas and developing management plans designed to restore, rehabilitate, or replace impacted areas.

AB  - Clapper rails (Rallus longirostris) were used as an indicator species of estuarine marsh habitat quality because of their strong site fidelity and predictable diet consisting of mostly benthic organisms. Mercury (Hg) and the polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) Aroclor 1268 concentrations were determined for sediments, crabs, as well as clapper rail adults and chicks collected from salt marshes associated with the LCP Superfund site in Brunswick, Georgia. Home ranges were established for adult rails, and sediment and crab samples were taken from each individual's range. The study was designed to minimize the spatial variability associated with trophic transfer studies by choosing an endpoint species with a potentially small home range and specifically sampling its foraging range. The mean home range for clapper rails was 1.2 ha with a median of 0.28 ha. Concentrations of Hg and Aroclor 1268 were shown to increase with each trophic level. Transfer factors between media followed the same pattern for both contaminants with the highest between fiddler crabs and clapper rail liver. Hg and PCB transfer factors were similar between sediment to fiddler crab and fiddler crab to muscle, however the PCB transfer factor from fiddler crabs to liver was over twice as large as for Hg. PCB congener profiles did not significantly differ between media types.

AB  - We investigated the visual ecology of the coloration of the eastern Atlantic fiddler crab, Uca tangeri, with particular attention to predator (e.g. avian) and conspecific vision. Spectral reflectance measurements were made on different body parts used in possible intraspecific communication as well as background habitats including crab-made materials (e.g. mudballs). Avian-based and crab-based visual models were used to obtain different estimates of crab conspicuousness to potential predators and conspecifics. We found that male body parts (except for dorsal carapace) were significantly more conspicuous to conspecific viewers than female equivalent body parts, and showed greater within-body contrast estimates. Moreover, male major claw areas differed in reflectance properties, producing variation in conspicuousness that fit signalling predictions: areas visible during claw-waving events were most conspicuous against the background sky, whereas areas visible in nonwaving positions were more conspicuous against substrate backgrounds. For avian vision, sexually dimorphic coloration results in males being generally more conspicuous than females (in terms of brightness contrast) against all backgrounds, however, there was no sexual dimorphic conspicuousness of carapace coloration. Furthermore, one of the most conspicuous features of both male and female crabs is an area that is likely to be more visible to crabs (mouthparts) than to avian predators from above. While conspicuousness varies with background, the most conspicuous background for male signalling parts (major claw) is dark mudballs, suggesting that males may increase the conspicuousness of their signals by modifying their signalling environment.

AB  - Burrowing by thalassinidean shrimp in modem tropical, shallow- subtidal to intertidal carbonate environments is widespread and a powerful agent of bioturbation, particularly within sandy substrates. Deep and intense burrowing by callianassids commonly occurs along the intertidal margins of hypersaline lagoons throughout the Bahamas, such as Pigeon Creek on San Salvador Island, where the sediments of extensive sand flats are thoroughly bioturbated by Glypturus acanthochirus. In addition to dominating the deep-tier infauna, G. acanthochirus is a true ecosystem engineer, and its prodigious burrowing activity results in a highly mounded topography. On sand flats, individual sediment cones commonly coalesce with time to form large composite mounds with surfaces stabilized by the development of microbial mats. This unique, biogenetically produced topography sets the stage for colonization by shallow- tier burrowers, particularly the upogebiid shrimp Upogebia vasquezi and several species of fiddler crabs. Burrow systems of U. vasquezi are distinctive and complex. They typically consist of a pair of U-shaped burrows in close proximity or criss-crossing, with knobs or short tunnels at their bases. The entire U-burrow pair is lined by a thick, externally pelleted wall. Inside burrow diameters range from 0.2 to 1 cm, and burrow depths are 10-15 cm, in contrast to the much deeper callianassid burrows. These complex upogebiid burrows also occur as trace fossils in late Pleistocene lagoon-margin facies of the Grotto Beach Formation on San Salvador. Initially reported as fragmentary burrow fills, whole burrow systems virtually identical to the modern upogebiid burrows recently have been found at several localities. These fossil burrows are most abundant in beds lying immediately below a terra rossa paleosol that marks the late Pleistocene-Holocene stratigraphic boundary, and the beds likely were deposited with sea-level stillstand and regression associated with the onset of Wisconsinan glaciation. With their high potential for preservation, these complex upogebiid trace fossils may prove useful as both paleoenvironmental and sea-level position indicators in the study of Quaternary carbonate sequences throughout the Bahamas and other geologically similar regions.

AB  - The stable isotope compositions (C, N, and S) of live, senescent, and standing dead Spartina alterniflora were compared in order to determine the effects of aerial decomposition on the isotopic signature of aboveground S. alterniflora tissue entering the food chain. Aerial decomposition of aboveground S. alterniflora resulted in a 6 to 18 permill increase in delta-34S, and a 2 to 3 permill decrease in delta-15N values; delta-13C values were unchanged. We describe mechanisms whereby the activity of fungi and epiphytic microorganisms may contribute to the observed shifts in delta-34S and delta-15N, respectively. The delta-13C value of salt marsh benthic and epiphytic microalgae ranged from -13.0 permill in summer to -17.6 permill in early spring. Average delta-15N values of microalgae and standing dead S. alterniflora were -0.3 and 1.7 permill , respectively, reflecting the activity of N-2-fixing microorganisms. The delta-15N values for omnivorous and herbivorous salt marsh macrofauna ranged between 7.5 and 2.2 permill , and for predatory Fundulus spp. delta-15N averaged 9.2 permill . Given a presumptive + 3 permill trophic shift in N assimilation, these results suggest that N-2-fixing microorganisms associated with microalgal communities were an important source of N to salt marsh consumers. The delta-13C, delta-15N, and delta-34S values of primary producers were compared to the values of the following consumers: Fundulus spp., Uca spp., Ilyanassa obsoleta, and Littoraria irrorata. delta-13C vs delta-15N and delta-13C vs delta-34S dual isotope plots demonstrated that microalgae and standing dead S. alterniflora are important food resources in the North Carolina (USA) marshes we sampled. In addition, a compilation of literature values suggests that this is true in salt marshes throughout the East and Gulf coasts of North America. Future isotope studies of marsh food webs should include detrital Spartina spp. material in analyses of trophic structure.

AB  - In this paper, we address the question of whether the presence of the burrowing crab Chasmagnathus gratulatus affects the habitat use of the fiddler crab Uca uruguayensis. Field samples showed that the species have a disjoint spatial distribution. Male fiddler crab density decreased in zones with C. granulatus, however, female density increased. Male fiddler crabs avoided feeding on sediment affected by C. granulatus and were more preyed. Predation was higher during the fiddler crab reproductive season and, probably due to predation risk, males showed lower reproductive display in shared zones. Field experiments shows that when C granulatus were excluded, densities of U. uruguayensis increased mainly due to an increase in density of males. Habitat differentiation of these species may be because C. granulatus affects U. uruguayensis in several ways, including direct predation, disturbance and behavioural changes associated to predation risk. Males and females are affected differentially probably because of the extreme sexual dimorphism of this crab species. Coloration on enlarged claw and waving activities are all factors that increase predation risk for mate and the presence of only one feeding claw may increase sediment-mediated effects.

AB  - A planted core system was developed to test the effect of short-term (1-2 wk) experimental manipulation of environmental parameters on edaphic microalgae under field conditions. A large number of small cores (surface area = 7 cm2) were collected, randomized and replanted in the marsh in fiddler crab exclosures with appropriate experimental treatments. Daily enrichment of the cores with NH4+ resulted in significant increases in edaphic primary productivity and levels of chlorophyll a in both summer and winter seasons in the short-Spartina marsh. Enrichment with a complete nutrient solution caused no further increases. Nutrient enrichment of creekbank sediments was much less stimulatory to the resident algal assemblage. In both sites, but especially in the creekbank, the removal of fiddler crab grazers resulted in significant increases in chlorophyll a and productivity. Experimental manipulation of light intensity showed that the average light intensity reaching the sediment surface was saturating for chlorophyll production in the short-Spartina marsh. A reciprocal transplant experiment involving unfertilized cores from the short-Spartina marsh and creekbank marsh demonstrated that NH4+ inputs occurring in the creekbank site rapidly alleviated N limitation of edaphic algae from short-Spartina marsh. Algae in creekbank cores incubated in the short-Spartina marsh were unable to sustain high productivity once the original standing stock of NH4+ declined.

AB  - Color change can serve a number of functions, and can be a singular aperiodic event or a rhythmic process driven by responses to environmental cues or endogenous rhythms. Endogenous pigmentation rhythms have been identified in a number of taxa, with fiddler crabs being the subject of much of this research. Despite a long history of experimental studies of chromatophore-level rhythmicity in fiddler crabs, few studies have considered the entrainment cues for these rhythms or extended findings to whole-organism coloration, information important for understanding the biological properties of circadian systems and understanding the functional significance of these rhythms. This study examined the circadian pigmentation rhythm in the subtropical fiddler crab Uca panacea at both the cellular (melanophore) and organismal levels, including expression in artificial light/dark cycles and constant darkness, entrainment by light/dark and temperature cycles, and relationships between melanophore rhythms and the spectral reflectance of the carapace. On the melanophore level, crabs exhibited a circadian rhythm in pigment dispersion, with maximum dispersion occurring during the day and maximum concentration occurring during the night. This rhythm persisted under ambient or reversed light/dark cycles, with maximum pigment dispersion occurring during the light phase, or under constant darkness. Both light/dark and temperature cycles entrained the rhythm, although light/dark cycles resulted in greater phase shift. The circadian rhythm in melanin dispersion within melanophores is associated with a circadian rhythm in organismal coloration, with carapace reflectance low during the day and high at night. Because of the high absorption of UV radiation by melanin, the functional significance of this rhythm may be as a mechanism of UV-protection during the day when crabs are exposed to high levels of UV radiation while foraging on open sand flats of the intertidal zone.

AB  - Sexual selection via endurance rivalry favors increased tenure at the breeding site but can be costly. Here, we investigated thermal constraints on endurance rivalry in fiddler crabs, a group well suited for studies of interactions between sexual and natural selection due to ritualized mating behaviors and extreme sexual dimorphism. Fiddler crab males display in thermally stressful high-intertidal breeding areas. Retreating into burrows, an effective thermoregulatory mechanism, requires a cessation of courtship behaviors. We predicted that males should spend more time on the surface than females and that their ability to do so should decrease with increasing body temperature. In contrast, the amount of time females spend on the surface should be little affected by body temperature. We tested these predictions in the fiddler crab Uca panacea by manipulating body temperatures and monitoring surface activity and habitat choice in large outdoor tanks during the breeding season. Males showed consistently higher surface activity than females. Effects of body temperature on surface activity were sex-specific, occurring in males but not in females, indicating sex-specific thermal constraints on surface behavior and supporting our hypothesized thermal constraints on endurance rivalry.

AB  - Fiddler crabs are highly sexually dimorphic. Males possess one small (minor) feeding claw and one greatly enlarged (major) claw; females possess two small claws. The major claw is used to attract mates and for burrow defense, but it is costly for the male to possess. We tested the hypothesis that the major claw also functions as a thermoregulatory structure, a function that would allow males to spend a greater amount of time at the surface, foraging and attracting potential mates. Fiddler crabs Uca panacea were exposed to a source of radiant heat and body temperatures were monitored. Four groups of crabs were tested: intact males, males with the minor claw removed, males with the major claw removed, and females. The body temperatures of males without the major claw increased more rapidly and reached higher values than did those of males with the major claw intact, but the results from these animals were similar to those of females. These results support the hypothesized thermoregulatory function of the major claw. The major claw may function as a heat sink, transferring heat away from the body and dissipating it into the air. Enhanced thermoregulatory ability provided by the major claw may partially ameliorate the energetic costs of possessing such a large claw.

AB  - To study ecdysteroid signaling during limb regeneration, we have applied RNAi (dsRNA) mediated silencing to EcR/RXR, the genes encoding the ecdysteroid receptor heterodimer, in the fiddler crab Uca pugilator. We injected RNAi into the blastemal chamber during early limb regeneration. Silencing was evaluated by knockdown in receptor transcript abundance, and disruption was evaluated by changes in growth rate and morphology of limb regenerates. q-PCR results indicated a 50% drop in transcript abundance 48 h post injection in both RNAi (dsEcR/dsRXR) injected ipsilateral and uninjected contralateral blastemas in experimental animals relative to controls. EcR/RXR transcript levels further decreased over time. Several phenotypes were associated with knockdown. The experimental blastema failed to develop; microscopic examination of the arrested blastema revealed an absence of the cuticular ingrowths characteristic of the beginnings of limb segmentation and cell proliferation assays revealed that the arrested blastema had few dividing cells. Ecdysteroid levels were also lowered in experimental animals; given the bilateral effects of RNAi on limb buds in experimental animals, these results suggest RNAi had a systemic effect. Although hormone titers in experimental animals rose to comparable control levels during the late proecdysial phase of limb regeneration, most experimental crabs failed to molt and died. The overall failure to molt indicates that RNAi receptor knockdown has long-term effects. The combined effects of receptor knockdown indicate that, although circulating ecdysteroid titers are normally low during basal limb bud growth, signaling via the ecdysteroid receptor pathway is necessary for establishment of blastemal cell proliferation and development in the regenerating limbs of U. pugilator.

AB  - Limb regeneration in fiddler crabs involves formation of a proliferating blastema, its differentiation into a segmented ‘mini limb’ (basal phase) and hypertrophic growth of the ‘mini limb’ via protein synthesis and water uptake (proecdysial phase). These phases are tightly coordinated with the molt cycle, i.e. accompanied by distinct fluctuations in circulating ecdysteroid titers, providing a useful model system to study changes in global gene expression. Among crustaceans, genomic and RNA-seq datasets are limited. We gave generated pilot transcriptome profiles to examine steady state changes in global gene expression during the limb regeneration process, including blastema, early and late proecdysial limb buds, using 454 and Illumina sequencing technology (NGS). Following sequencing, the reads were assembled de-novo by using the Newbler Assembler for 454 and the Trinity and SOAP Assemblers for Illumina sequence data. We have generated 103,700 and 704,395 sequences (all libraries combined) from the 454 and Illumina platforms, respectively. The average contig lengths from proecdysial libraries built by the three assemblers were: 511 bp (Newbler), 186 bp (Trinity) and 629 bp (SOAP). Analyses of the sequence data are available online at http://www.genome.ou.edu/crab.html, where the databases are both BLAST and keyword searchable. The database contains putative isoforms not detected through cDNA library cloning or anchored PCR. We have also obtained metabolic profiles from early blastemal, and early and late proecdysial limb buds using the KEGG database. Further analysis of metabolic profiles, in association with experimental manipulation of ecdysteroid responsiveness, should provide information on gene pathways subject to ecdysteroid control.

AB  - The hemolymph ionic composition and unidirectional Na+ fluxes were analyzed in fiddler crabs (Uca) acclimated to 500 mosmol seawater. Eyestalkless crabs had lower hemolymph osmotic, Na+, and Cl- concentrations. The Na+ efflux was increased from 13.6 +/- 0.6 in control crabs to 19.6 +/- 1.3 mueq.g-1.h-1 in eyestalkless crabs; this increase was shown to be due to a higher Na+ permeability in eyestalkless crabs. Hemolymph Na+ in eyestalkless crabs was increased by an injection of eyestalk extract. The Na+ influx was increased from 11.1 in intact to 15.8 mueq.g-1.h-1 in eyestalkless animals. A kinetic study showed that 1) the influx was higher at all external Na+ concentrations in eyestalkless and intact-Na+-depleted crabs than in intact controls, and 2) the influx mechanism exhibited allosterism. The elevated Na+ influx in eyestalkless crabs was decreased by an injected eyestalk extract. An injected brain extract caused in increase in the Na+ influx in intact animals. It is concluded that the Na+ uptake mechanism is activated by decreasing the hemolymph Na+ concentration and that a brain hormone mediates the effect.

AB  - Fiddler crabs are a group of small, intertidal crustaceans that exhibit a high degree of sexual dimorphism. Male fiddler crabs are characterized by strong body asymmetry, as the large major claw can constitute more than half of the organism's body mass. Males within this genus both wave the major claw to attract a mate during courtship, and also fight with the major claw for control of mating burrows. Both of these functions are essential for male mating success. Fiddler crab species are highly variable in claw morphology and in the kinematics of waving. Here, we quantify energetic investment in waving across 14 species of fiddler crabs. Using field observations and video analysis of courtship, we calculated waving rates (waves/second), waving time budgets (percent time spent waving), and the energetic cost of a wave (Joules/wave). Additionally, morphological and mechanical measurements were made for each of these species. Wave energetics are highly variable across species. Work (J) per wave varies by two orders of magnitude. Wave rates ranged from 0.29 to 1.1 waves/second. All species studied waved frequently during courtship periods, with 28% to 77% of time spent waving. Combining these data sets, we estimate each species' energetic commitment to waving. We then use these data to test hypotheses about the relationship between waving investment and morphology (e.g. body size, claw force), and reproductive behavior.

AB  - This study was developed to evaluate the population structure of Uca thayeri in the Rio Formoso estuary, state of Pernambuco, northeast Brazil. Samplings of the specimens were performed monthly (April 2009 to March 2010), and 2,124 individuals were collected (1,014 males, 1110 females, and 237 of these were ovigerous). The males had a mean body size (carapace width) (15.3 mm) similar to that of females (15.0 mm). Males and females (50% of the population) reached morphological sexual maturity with 12.7 and 13.8 mm CW, respectively. The total frequency distribution in size classes of males and females was unimodal. The overall sex ratio was skewed in favor of females (0.91: 1.0). The ovigerous females and juveniles were continuous throughout the year, but the ovigerous females more frequent in summer and juveniles in winter and summer. The mean fecundity was 8,859 eggs, ranging from 1,400 to 23,850 eggs. These results show that the population of U thayeri is well established in the Rio Formoso mangrove, where environmental conditions appear to be sufficient to accomplish its vital functions such as feeding and reproduction. However, when compared to other populations in southeastern Brazil, there are some distinct population aspects, especially the reproductive period that was continuous and lower fecundity, probably due to the latitudinal variation.

AB  - This work deals with carcinolithes of the Baunilha Grande ecofacies of the Pirabas Formation, sampled at the locality of Baunilha, northeastern Para State. The study includes petrographical and diagenetic studies, as well as geochemical (quantitative) and isotopic87 Sr/86Sr analysis of decapod carapaces. A unique depositional microfacies (biomicrite) of carcinolithes was characterized, by a mineralogical composition of quartz, calcite, Mg kutnohorite, pirite, fluorapatite and kaolinite. Allocheme elements are represented by decapod crustaceans, benthonic and planktonic forarninifera, diatoms, ostracods, microbivalves, echinoderms, calcareous algae and plants fragments besides faecal pellets and bioturbation structures. Seven presumebly simultaneous eodiagenetic processes were identified: replacement of the organic matter by calcite, pyritization of the organic matter, phosphatization of the organic matter, mechanical compaction, formation of CaCO3, fringe, local dissolution of CaCO3, precipitated in pores and replacement of the calcite by silica. The high values of isotopic ratio87Sr/86Sr obtained from carapaces fragments of Uca maracoani, suggested that the paleohabitat of this decapod received great influence of elastics deposits. This study corroborates paleopalinological inferences about the paleoenvironmental characterization of the Baunilha Grande as a mangrove deposit.

AB  - Formation of burrow-head mud volcanoes by the mud-loving amphibious crab Uca marionis (Alcock) selectively on the either sides of estuary mouths along the Bay of Bengal coast, eastern India, requires peculiar substratal and biological conditions where soft muddy bottom sediments of the coastal mudflats are covered by a thin blanket of relatively rigid beach sands that provide a false substrate stability. Shallow-seated mud layers, being within the substrate penetration power, allow opportunistic burrowing by the crab and consequent oozing out of internal mud slur to firm conical heaps of mud resembling volcanic cones. Removal of this thin sand cover prompts very fast erosion of the bottom mud and consequent widening of the estuary mouth and rapid beach erosion. A thick and rigid solid cover restricts deeper burrowing by the crabs. Uca marionis mud volcanoes, by virtue of limited power of vertical penetration down to required muddy substrate and requirement of special substrate conditions and geomorphic position along the coastal zone, are considered as unique ichnological tools that readily identify and precisely demarcate highly unstable or erosion-prone beach sectors, and thus help in planning, protection and execution Of various coastal developmental programs. Wide zoogeographic distribution of Uca in tropical-subtropical sea coasts greatly enhances the application potential of this new ichnological tool. Fossilized biogenic mud volcanoes in post-Jurassic geologic records would ease taxonomic identification of the ancient trace producers cold coastal marine palaeogeomorphic interpretations.

AB  - Field observations and laboratory experiments were performed to analyze the burrow plugging behavior of U. uruguayensis and to analyze its relation to two environmental cycles: light-dark cycle and tides. Field observations showed that burrow plugging is a rhythmic behavior synchronized with both environmental cycles such that burrows are open during those periods of simultaneous light and low tide. Laboratory experiments suggested that the plugging rhythm is under endogenous circadian control, whereas its synchronization with the tidal cycle, particularly with periodic inundation, seems to be strongly exogenous, not showing clear circatidal components. It is proposed that burrow plugging is adaptive because it allows the animals to be within an air medium, more suitable for their respiration modality, during high tide and because it prevents burrow collapse. It is also proposed that both the endogenous circadian component and the lack of an endogenous circatidal component can also be explained on the basis of adaptive value, taking into account the regular temporal structure of the solar day and the irregular temporal structure of the tidal cycle.

AB  - This study was conducted to assess the physiological and ecological factors that influence prey selection of White Ibises breeding at a coastal colony site on Pumpkinseed Island, Georgetown County, South Carolina. To understand habitat use of individual ibises, the activity of radiotagged adults was monitored in three breeding seasons (1987-1989). Ibises caring for prefledglings fed mainly in freshwater swamps, impoundments, ponds, and abandoned rice fields, and visited saltmarshes less frequently. Following chick rearing, radiotagged ibises increased their use of local saltmarshes. The reproductive effort of breeding populations in 1985-1989 varied with the composition and osmolarity of nestling diets. Both nestling growth and survival were negatively correlated with dietary osmolarity, which in turn, was influenced by dietary composition. Diets containing fewer crayfishes and more fiddler crabs had higher osmotic concentrations than did those containing mostly crayfishes and fewer fiddler crabs. Nestlings grew slower during years in which the diet was higher in fiddler crabs and faster during years in which the diet contained a larger percentage of crayfishes and fewer fiddler crabs. The size of the breeding population was also negatively correlated with dietary osmolarity. In experimental prey selection trials using freeze-killed prey, captive ibises included fewer fiddler crabs in their diets when caring for prefledglings than they did prior to chick rearing. During chick rearing, ibises selected mainly crayfishes and fishes. Using homogenized diets of freeze-killed prey, hand-fed nestlings were most efficient at digesting a diet of crayfishes or fishes, less efficient at digesting a mixture of fiddler crabs, crayfishes, and fishes, and incapable of processing a pure diet of fiddler crabs. Most captive adults increased their consumption of fiddler crabs after chick rearing, but still preferred crayfishes. Captive adults were least efficient at digesting freeze-killed fiddler crabs and most efficient at digesting freeze-killed crayfishes. These results suggest that (1) parental ibises select crayfishes to maintain the nestling diet at an acceptable osmolarity and provide adequate nutrition to their young, (2) free-ranging adults switch to feeding on fiddler crabs after chick rearing because crayfishes become scarce at the end of the breeding season, (3) natural and man-made events that affect crayfish availability will influence the feeding ecology of White Ibises, and consequently, decrease their reproductive output, and (4) the preservation of freshwater wetlands is important for maintaining breeding populations of White Ibises in coastal areas.

AB  - During the summer of 1989, we examined mechanisms of egg hatching in three species of brachyurans that occupy different habitats as adults near Beaufort, North Carolina, USA: Neopanope sayi (Smith) (subtidal), Uca pugilator (Bosc) (intertidal) and Sesarma cinereum (Bosc) (supratidal). Results of casein assays indicated that embryos of all species release proteolytic enzymes near the time of egg hatching. Species differences in specific enzyme activity were suggested, with increased activity in the more terrestrial crabs. Embryos of N. sayi released enzymes several hours before larval release by the female, while U. pugilator and S. cinereum released enzymes closer to the time of larval release; enzyme release coincided roughly with time of egg-membrane breakage in all species. Direct observations of hatching showed a sequence of outer-membrane breakage apparently followed by inner-membrane breakage and emergence of the larva. Egg volumes increased most during early and/or mid-stages of development, with a marked slowing of the increase during the several days before hatching. Thus, a gradual osmotically-driven increase in water content may also be involved in egg hatching.

AB  - Control of egg-hatching time was investigated in the crabs Neopanope sayi, Uca pugilator, and Sesarma cinereum, which occupy a gradient in adult habitats from sublittoral to supralittoral zones, respectively. Hatching time was monitored in the laboratory for eggs attached to females and for eggs removed several hours prior to eclosion. Embryos of all species hatched into larvae swimming independently of the female; however, those of U. pugilator and S. cinereum hatched several hours later and with lower viability than attached eggs. Mean hatching times of attached and detached eggs were correlated for N. sayi, but not for U. pugilator or S. cinereum. These results strongly imply that the embryos are the principal controllers of hatching time in N. sayi but not in U. pugilator or S. cinereum. For all species, removed eggs hatched over a longer time interval than attached eggs, indicating that the female is responsible for the synchrony of release.

Increases in the readiness of attached eggs to hatch prior to actual time of larval release were relatively moderate in N. sayi, but more rapid and dramatic for U. pugilator and S. cinereum. These changes are likely the result of enzymatic degradation of the egg membranes. We postulate that, for N. sayi, enzyme release is controlled by rhythms in the embryos, but, for U. pugilator and S. cinereum, females signal the embryos to release enzymes, resulting in rapid degradation of the membranes. Selection for control of larval release time by the female may be especially important in terrestrial and semiterrestrial crabs.

AB  - Control of egg hatching was investigated in ovigerous females of the crab Neopanope sayi. Larval release is a brief event, generally lasting less than 15 min, during which females perform stereotypic behaviors involving vigorous abdomen pumping. Substances released by hatching eggs (pumping factors) of N. sayi, Rhithropanopeus harrisii, and Uca pugilator, but not Sesarma cinereum, evoked these stereotypic behaviors (pumping response) in ovigerous N. sayi. Spontaneous pumping and responsiveness to pumping factors varied with the age of the embryos. These results indicate that the eggs release pheromones around the time of hatching, which supports the general model for egg-hatching control described for R. harrisii (Forward and Lohmann, 1983). The chemistry of N. sayi pumping factors was investigated, and the pumping-response was used as a bioassay in this study, Pumping factors adsorbed to Amberlite XAD-7 resin and could be eluted from it with methanol. Size fractionation by cascade pressure dialysis showed that the active molecules were < 1000 daltons. Acid hydrolysis followed by reverse-phase HPLC amino acid analysis showed that the biologically active fraction contained peptides. Cysteine, glycine, methionine, and isoleucine were the four most common amino acids in these peptides. The responsiveness of N. sayi to hatch water from K. harrisii, the general similarity of adsorptive characteristics of hatch waters from the two species toward XAD-7 resin, and the amino acid compositional analysis suggest that the pumping factors from both species are similar. This supports the hypothesis that N. sayi pumping factors are also small peptides, as was suggested for those of R. harrisii (Rittschof et al., 1985, 1989).

AB  - Abundances of brachyuran megalopae and juveniles were measured throughout consecutive tidal cycles during six 2 to 3 d sampling periods in summer 1992, and associated with rates of change of tidal hydrologic variables in the Newport River Estuary. Current speeds and rates of pressure change fitted sinusoidal (tidal) models well; however, rates of salinity and temperature change did not. Analysis of plankton samples taken during spring and neap tides showed peak abundances during nighttime rising tides for all taxonomic groups: Callinectes sapidus, Uca spp., Xanthidae, and Pinnixa spp. megalopae, and Pinnotheres spp. juveniles. Megalopal and juvenile abundances from time-intensive sampling were related to rates of changes in the hydrologic variables using stepwise logistic regression. No hydrologic variable accounted well for the presence of Uca spp. megalopae. Megalopal presence was best predicted by current speed for Pinnixa spp. megalopae, and rates of changes in pressure for xanthid megalopae and Pinnotheres spp. juveniles, and salinity for C. sapidus megalopae. These variables might act as cues causing megalopae to ascend into the water column at a particular point in the flooding tide, and subsequently descend to or near the bottom prior to ebb flow. In this way, larvae which develop on the continental shelf or lower estuary undergo transport up the estuary by behaviorally altering their swimming activity and depth concurrent with tidal changes.

AB  - Recent evidence suggests that physiological characteristics may be the proximate cause of some animal behaviors. To investigate this claim we conducted two studies examining the relationship between physiology, via internal energy stores, and behavior in the sand fiddler crab, Uca pugilator. Energy stores were quantified through determination of the condition of the hepatopancreas, an internal organ in crustaceans that houses nutrients used in growth and reproduction. In the first study, energy stores and their relationship with personality in females was examined. Personality is defined as stable expression of a behavioral trait and naturally occurs in one of two ways: context-specifically or context-generally. The former is characterized by consistent responses in only one ecological scenario, whereas the latter is characterized by consistency that spans scenarios. We collected measurements of two behaviors per individual within the contexts of predator avoidance and exploration of a novel environment. Correlations within and between these measurements were examined, as well as their relationship with the mass and lipid content of the hepatopancreas. Results suggest the majority of crabs were bold in the context of hiding time yet shy in the exploration context. This context-specific behavior was not explained by physiology. Our results suggest that flexible expression of personality traits may occur in the absence of an underlying physiological driver. In the second study, differences in the energy stores of courting and foraging male fiddler crabs were examined. There is abundant evidence that male sexual signaling in this genus is condition-dependent and that current energy reserves may limit courtship behaviors. Therefore, males engaged in each activity were sampled every two weeks for the duration of a mating season and the mass of their hepatopancreases were compared. Sediment organic content was also measured at each sampling event to track food availability throughout the study. We found that hepatopancreas mass was only weakly related to activity (waving or foraging). Additionally, this physiological variable was not significantly affected by variation in sediment organic content within the habitat. Our results suggest that natural fluctuations in food availability and energetic state are not the primary drivers of male fiddler crab behavioral decisions.

AB  - Consistent individual behavioral differences across ecological contexts are a recognized feature of animal populations. These differences can be expressed in two ways: context-specifically or context-generally. The former is characterized by consistent responses in one context (i.e. repeatability), whereas the latter by consistency that spans contexts (i.e. behavioral syndromes). The proximate causes of behavioral consistency remain unclear, yet there is evidence that physiology may couple the expression of some behavioral traits in unrelated contexts. We therefore explored the correlation between bold behavior of female sand fiddler crabs (Uca pugilator) and the condition of the hepatopancreas, an organ vital to crustacean metabolism and reproduction. We did this by taking replicate measurements of two risk-taking behaviors per individual in the contexts of predator avoidance and environment exploration, and examining correlations within and between these observations. We then determined the relationship of behavior with hepatopancreas mass and lipid content. Individual crabs responded consistently within each context. However, across-context correlations were absent, indicating that boldness is isolated, at least in the selected scenarios. Additionally, anti-predator and exploratory behaviors were significantly influenced by size but not linked to hepatopancreas physiology. Our results show that context-specific trait expression may occur in the absence of a physiological correlate.

AB  - Thallium (Tl) is an extremely toxic but little-studied element in the marine environment and practically no information has been reported on the levels of Tl in marine organisms. After the Aznalcollar mining spill (April 1998), high levels of metals were put into the environment. This acid-contaminated medium was responsible for the initial pollution effects measured in the Guadiamar River, which is an affluent of the Guadalquivir River and very close to the biggest natural reserve in Europe (Donana). Four different species were used in the monitoring from April to September 1998 and a sediment field bioassay to check bioacumulation was performed. We present the first ecotoxicological evaluation of the mining spill in the Guadalquivir River, with reference to Tl, a little-known metal. Also, Pb and Cd data were compared to Tl during field sediment testing. Results show low levels of this metal in all of the organisms studied and they do not show any increase in the level of this metal,ranging from 40 to 90 ng g-1, 80 to 210 ng g-1, 15 to 98 ng g-1 and 75 to 125 whole body dry weight for Scrobicularia plana, Liza ramada (muscle), Crassostrea angulata and Uca tangeri, respectively. These are the first field data of Tl concentration measured using estuarine organisms. Field sediment toxicity test results confirm those obtained during the monitoring: Tl is not bioaccumulated by the organisms (C. angulata) used in the test. The sequence in bioaccumulation of metals was Cd > Pb > Tl. Both studies, bioaccumulation and sediment toxicity, should be maintained during the next few years to really evaluate the potential effect of the mining spill on the ecosystem and society.

AB  - The review uses data obtained by the authors and data available in the literature to discuss microbial collagenolytic enzymes, widely employed in scientific research, biotechnology, and medicine. Collagenases differing in their structure and the specificity of their action on collagen fibrils were isolated from bacteria (including marine isolates), actinomycetes, and fungi. Collagenases produced by Clostridium histolyticum and Achromobacter iophagus are the best studied enzymes; both are metalloenzymes that contain Zn2+ in their active site and retain collagenolytic activity in the presence of Ca2+ Serine-type collagenolytic proteases were also found in microorganisms. These enzymes differ from ''true'' collagenases by the structure of their active site. Both serine proteases and metalloproteases with high collagenolytic activities were isolated from the culture liquids of Streptomyces and Actinomyces strains. The biosynthesis of collagenases is induced by the addition of various collagenase substrates to the cultivation medium.

AB  - Intertidal species, such as the fiddler crab Uca pugilator, have long served as models for studying endogenous tidal rhythms in marine organisms. Previous studies indicate that U. pugilator from areas with semi-diurnal tides exhibit a circatidal activity rhythm in which the active phase occurs at low tide. However, few studies have compared the activity patterns of crabs from areas with different tidal patterns. To test the hypothesis that crabs possess circatidal rhythms that match their local tidal regime, the locomotory behavior of male U. pugilator from non-tidal areas and from beaches with semi-diurnal, diurnal, and mixed tides were analyzed under constant conditions. Crab activity was monitored for one week using an infrared actograph system and the resulting time series was analyzed using periodogram analysis. While all four groups of crabs exhibited endogenous rhythms in activity, there were significant differences in the dominant periodicities present in the time series. Crabs from semi-diurnal areas possessed rhythms with a dominant periodicity of 12.2 h, whereas those from diurnal areas exhibited rhythms with peaks in activity at 23.3 h. Crabs from areas with mixed tides possessed rhythms with dominant periodicities of 12.5 h and 24.4 h, corresponding to the main semi-diurnal (M2 and S2) and diurnal (K1 and O1) components of the tidal regime at the collection site. Actographs of crabs collected from non-tidal areas also contained two significant peaks in activity at 11.9 h and 23.3 h. Peaks in activity for crabs from tidal areas were synchronized with times of expected falling tide. Given the proximity of the collection sites, differences in the activity patterns of the four populations suggest that the circatidal behaviors of U. pugilator are phenotypically plastic.

AB  - Male fiddler crabs, genus Uca, have one greatly enlarged claw with which they court females and threaten and fight other males. Longer claws are more effective signals but are thought to be less effective weapons because the relative closing force at the tip of the claw decreases with claw length. We studied claw morphology and fighting in Uca terpsichores and Uca beebei and found a mechanism that may resolve opposing selection for signaling and fighting ability. When males fought they delivered gripping forces not at the tips but at the tubercles on the inner margins of their claws' fingers. As claws grow, these tubercles remain relatively close to the apex of the gape. Consequently, the mechanical advantage that governs the forces that can be delivered at these tubercles decreases only slightly with increasing claw length allowing the claw to be an effective signal and a powerful weapon. Animal weapons are exceptionally diverse in form and detail of armature and the causes of this diversity are poorly understood. We suggest that the designs of weapons may often reflect compensatory patterns of growth and placement of armature that enhances the weapon's overall utility for multiple uses in competition for mates.

AB  - This research investigates the causes of a male-biased operational sex ratio in a population of the California fiddler crab, Uca crenulata. Mensurative studies revealed there were almost twice as many adult males as females, mating occurred across half of the days within the breeding season, and females had much longer individual reproductive cycles than males. Therefore, many more males than females were available for mating on each breeding day. Perhaps as a consequence, males spent a large proportion of their time fighting with neighbors and rapidly waving their large claws when females passed by.

AB  - Investigating factors that influence which sex searches for a mate helps to identify how and why mating location and the degree of selectivity for mates change with ecological conditions. Several ecological factors that are thought to affect which sex searches - density, sediment size, and predation - were measured in two populations of the fiddler crab, Uca crenulata. At one of these populations, two additional factors, clutch size and larval release synchrony, also were measured because these factors may affect females' reliance on male-defended stationary resources. Females produced clutches that protruded beyond their abdomens and they released larvae synchronously at biweekly intervals throughout the breeding season. Density, sediment size, and predation levels varied between the two populations. Only females searched for mates at the high-density, predator-free, sandy site, while both sexes searched at the low-density site that contained more silt and predators. Females did not stop searching when density was lowered in experimental enclosures set in the sandier area. This suggests that density is less important in determining which sex searches when sediment grain and clutch size are both large.

AB  - When individuals benefit from highly selective mate choice and search costs are negligible, they should sample all or at least many potential mates. Most animals sample just a few mates, presumably because search costs override the benefits of lengthy searches. Observations on mate-searching female California fiddler crabs, Uca crenulata, showed that these crabs conducted much longer searches than have been reported for other animals. Moreover, large and small females used different sampling strategies. Searches may be long in this species because females use multiple criteria to select mates and benefit from finding a burrow of the right size. They chose mates that (1) were near to their size (2) had small claws given their body size, and (3) defended long burrows with entrances that matched the size of the female. Females sampled many burrows that did not match their size, indicating that they assessed burrows on contact and not before. An experiment examining why females use male burrow diameter as a mate choice criteria revealed that burrow opening diameter, or a correlate, affected incubation duration and therefore release time of larvae. Larvae were successfully released during high-amplitude nocturnal tides only when females incubated in burrows that allowed the larvae to exit the estuary swiftly and thus reduce predation risk, but not when females incubated in burrows that were too wide or narrow. The effect of burrow aperture on incubation duration may explain why females sampled many male burrows as they searched for a mate and why females of different size classes selected and sampled differently.

AB  - In most species, only one sex searches for mates while the other waits. Models, of sex-specific mate-searching behavior predict single-sex searching, but the factors that determine which sex searches are not understood. In this study, we examine the effects of density and predation risk on mate- searching behavior in the fiddler crab Uca beebei. U. beebei is one of the few fiddler-crab species in which both sexes search for mates. In a field experiment conducted in Panama, we manipulated crab density and perceived predation risk in replicate plots. Females searched more and males searched less at high densities. At high levels of-perceived predation risk, both sexes similarly reduced their search rates. Observations of plots that naturally varied in crab density show that females were more likely to search for mates in areas of higher density, where there were more males. Females may preferentially search for mates in high-density areas because the abundance of nearby burrows, into which they can run to escape predators, decreases their costs of searching and because the abundance of males and male burrows facilitates comparisons and thus may increase their benefits from searching. Males at high densities decrease their mate- searching rate perhaps in response to the increase in female searching and to the corresponding increase in the intensity of their competitors' mate-attraction signals.

AB  - We present a comparative analysis of mate searching in fiddler crabs, genus Uca. Several ecological factors determine which sex will search for mates and how complex male signaling will be. Female searching is most tightly correlated with mating in male burrows. Female searching is associated with high burrow density small body size, and large soil size. These factors explain variation in a female's need for male-defended incubation sites. Female searching also is correlated with short eyestalks. In species in which females search for mates, males use a more complex mate attraction signal than in species in which males search.

AB  - Although the role of colour in mate choice is well known, few tests of colour vision have been based on mating behaviour. Females of the fiddler crab Uca mjoebergi have recently been shown to use claw coloration to recognize conspecific males. In this study I demonstrate that the females use colour vision for this task; preferentially approaching yellow claws over grey claws regardless of their intensity while failing to discriminate between yellow claws differing in intensity. This is one of only a handful of studies confirming the involvement of colour vision in mate choice and the first conclusive evidence in fiddler crabs.

AB  - The perception of ultraviolet light and its role in communication has received a great deal of attention in recent years. Although ultraviolet light is no different to other wavelengths in many respects, its role as a signal does deserve special consideration, if only because it is frequently overlooked by human observers who are unable to see it. Studies on the role of ultraviolet cues in inter- and intrasexual interactions are still rare, and generally focused on vertebrates with relatively complex visual systems. Here we show for the first time that crustaceans, with a relatively simple, probably dichromatic, visual system, also use ultraviolet cues in mate choice. We found that the enlarged claws of male Uca mjoebergi reflect ultraviolet wavelengths of light. Mate-searching females preferred ultraviolet-reflecting males over those whose reflectance was blocked with sunscreen. Conspecific males showed no such preference when deciding which rival to attack, suggesting that ultraviolet cues are not involved in signalling competitive ability.

AB  - Fiddler crabs are generally considered polygamous as they lend to live in dense mixed sex colonies with numerous neighbours and individually defended territories. We show that the Australian fiddler crab, Uca capricornis, is socially monogamous based oil behavioural experiments and observations of neighbouring males and females. The unusual relationship between neighbouring males and females in U. capricornis is selected for and maintained by intrasexual aggression and the ability to recognise and defend their partner.

AB  - Mating signals are often directed at numerous senses and provide information about species identity, gender, receptiveness, individual identity and mate quality. Given the diversity of colourful body patterns in invertebrates, surprisingly few studies have examined the role of these visual signals in mate recognition. Here, we demonstrate the use of claw coloration as a species recognition signal in a fiddler crab (Uca mjoebergi). Furthermore, we show that distinct carapace colour patterns in Uca capricornis enable males to discriminate between their female neighbours and unfamiliar females. This is the first empirical evidence of the social importance of colour markings in fiddler crabs and the first example of visually mediated species and neighbour recognition in invertebrates other than insects.

AB  - Colour changes in animals may be triggered by a variety of social and environmental factors and may occur over a matter of seconds or months. Crustaceans, like fiddler crabs (genus Uca), are particularly adept at changing their colour and have been the focus of numerous studies. However, few of these studies have attempted to quantitatively describe the individual variation in colour and pattern or their adaptive significance. This paper quantitatively describes the colour patterns of the fiddler crab Uca capricornis and their ability to change on a socially significant timescale. The most dramatic changes in colour pattern are associated with moulting. These ontogenetic changes result in a general reduction of the colour pattern with increasing size, although females are more colourful and variable than similarly-sized males. Uca capricornis are also capable of rapid colour changes in response to stress, but show no endogenous rhythms associated with the semilunar and tidal cycles commonly reported in other fiddler crabs. The extreme colour polymorphism and the relative stability of the colour patterns in Uca capricornis are consistent with their use in visually mediated mate recognition.

AB  - Neighboring territory owners are often less aggressive toward each other than to strangers ("dear enemy" effect). There is, however, little evidence for territorial defense coalitions whereby a neighbor will temporarily leave his/her own territory, enter that of a neighbor, and cooperate in repelling a conspecific intruder. This is surprising, as theoreticians have long posited the existence of such coalitions and the circumstances under which they should evolve. Here we document territorial defense coalitions in the African fiddler crab Uca annulipes, which lives in large colonies wherein each male defends a burrow and its surrounding area against neighbors and "floaters" (burrowless males). Fights between a resident and a floater sometimes involve another male who has left his territory to fight the floater challenging his neighbor. Using simple experiments, we provide the first evidence of the rules determining when territorial coalitions form. Our results support recent models that suggest that these coalitions arise from by-product mutualism.

AB  - We investigated the relationship between sex, size and colour in the little studied Australian endemic semaphore crab, Heloecius cordiformis, and related it to the crabs' social system with the aim of identifying the potential signalling function of claw colour.Equal sampling of crabs from all size classes revealed a strong relationship between sex, size and claw Colour. Purple-clawed males were larger and had larger claws than pink-, orange- or green-clawed males. Male claws showed positive allometric growth: relative to body size, purple-clawed males had larger claws. The largest females had pink claws; the few With Purple claws were no larger than immature green-clawed crabs. Female claws grow isometrically with the body so the relative claw size did not differ among the female colour classes. Quantitative measurements of claw colour revealed spectral differences between these Subjectively described colours. The purple claws typical of large males also contrasted more strongly against the mudflat background than the other colours.Heloecius copulate outside female-owned burrows and probably within male-owned burrows. The male's waving display, in which both claws are raised and lowered, may feature in both mating strategies: as a territorial display and to attract wandering females. Large males are competitively Superior so size, and potentially colour, are important in territorial disputes and may also feature in mate choice. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

For the cadmium exposed crabs, LDH activity in the hepatopancreas decreased, whereas that in the abdominal muscle increased. 3. The increased LDH activity in the abdominal muscle may reflect increased dependence on anaerobic carbohydrate metabolism in fiddler crabs exposed to cadmium in their environment.

AB  - Population structure of Uca maracoani (Decapoda, Brachyura, Ocypodidae) from the tidal flat of Baixio Mirim, Guaratuba Bay, Parana State, Brazil. A study about the annual fluctuation of the abundance, size composition, sexual proportion, reproductive period and juvenile recruitment of the fiddler crab Uca maracoani (Latreille, 1802-1803) was carried out in a population living in a tidal flat at Guaratuba Bay, Parana State, Brazil (48 degrees 36'W e 25 degrees 52'S). Crabs were obtained from February 2005 to January 2006, during low spring tides, in monthly collections, and their carapace width was measured. Air temperature oscillated from 17 to 29 degrees C, luminosity from 8,740 to 151,300 lux, salinity from 8 to 25 and soil temperature (on surface, 5 cm, 10 cm, 15 cm and 20 cm depth) from 18.3 to 28.9 degrees C. A total of 7,120 individuals were analyzed, among them, 2,578 were sexually indefinite juveniles, 2,377 males (1,113 juveniles and 1,264 mature males) and 2,165 females (944 juveniles, 1,135 mature and 86 ovigerous females). Population abundance oscillated 341 (April) to 994 individuals (January), but its annual fluctuation was not correlated to the oscillation of the abiotic variables. The sexual proportion was 1: 1 and the reproduction of the species is continuous type, with two peaks of intensity in the year: one in April and another in November. Juvenile recruitment is also continuous with two periods of intensity in the year: in July and in December-January. Sexually indefinite juveniles measured from 1.14 to 2.62 mm carapace width, juvenile males from 2.58 to 17.83 mm, juvenile females from 2.60 to 11.72 mm, mature males from 17.85 to 35.81 mm and mature females from 11.75 to 31.76 mm. Males reach larger sizes than females.

AB  - Fiddler crabs consume the surficial microphytobenthos around their burrows during low tide. We studied the spatial and temporal feeding patterns in the species Uca uruguayensis by using sequences of digital pictures of feeding pellets accumulation. Data from 61 crabs, feeding without the interference of neighbors, were fitted to different models using Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian approaches. Initial feeding location was independent from the emergence location, and then, crabs continued holding a main feeding direction (clockwise or counterclockwise), suggesting a systematic mechanism that may avoid feeding over already processed sediment. Crabs used at least half of their potential feeding area, but these areas were heterogeneous. Both sexes developed similar feeding areas; however, females were faster and needed less time to feed than males, suggesting that males are time restricted. Our work also highlights the importance of incorporating other underlying mechanisms of the behavior of species into the study of feeding strategies.

AB  - During 1997-1999, a total of 94 crabs, Uca rapax were collected from La Sabana, La Ceiba and El Paujil, Sucre State, Venezuela. Of these 36 were infected with metacercariae. Two parasites were located in the abdominal muscles and one under the tissue of carapace and gonad. These metacercariae grew to adults in the following genera: Levinseniella, Microphallus and Maritrema, in the period of 2-5 days after feeding experimentally to the rat Rattus norvegicus, mice Mus musculus and duck Cairinia moschata. Specimens of the genus Microphallus were described herein as a new species M. sabanensis. The life cycle of M. sabanensis sp.nov. were studied experimentally using rat, mice and duck. All developmental stages and the adult are described. In addition, M. sabanensis was collected from wild birds Anas discors, Pluvialis squatarola, Butorides striatus, Egretta caerulea and Nycticorax violaceus from the same localities.

AB  - Identifying differential population structure within metacommunities is key toward describing the mechanisms that maintain biodiversity in natural systems. At both local and regional scales on the North American Atlantic coast, we assessed phylogeographic and genetic diversity patterns of six common salt marsh invertebrates using equivalent sampling schemes and sequence data from the same mitochondrial locus. In general, our results suggest little genetic structure across four previously sampled biogeographic regions and a slight increase in genetic diversity from northern to southern areas; however, two of the species (Geukensia demissa and Uca pugilator) exhibited significant differentiation between the northernmost populations and other regions, consistent with a number of previous studies. Although the minimal genetic structure recovered in this community is consistent with expectations based on the larval life history of the species examined, confirmation of this result suggests that latitudinal shifts in ecological interactions in salt marsh systems are environmentally driven, rather than due to heritable adaptation.

AB  - Mangrove crabs as key ecosystem engineers may play an important role in the recovery process of storm-damaged forests. Yet, their response to storm disturbance is largely unknown. Here we compare the ground-dwelling brachyuran crab community of intact mangrove stands with that of typhoon gaps having experienced 100% tree mortality. Field work was conducted in two adjacent areas in Can Gio Biosphere Reserve, southern Vietnam. In each area, an 18-20 yr old monoculture Rhizophora apiculata stand served as control and was compared with typhoon gaps where downed stems had been removed or left on-site. The gaps were 14 and 20 months old when studied in the dry and rainy season 2008, respectively. Time-based sampling of ground-dwelling crabs with hand or shovel was conducted by 4 persons inside 100 m(2) plots for 30 min (7 replicate plots per area, treatment and month). Abiotic (sediment pH, salinity, temperature, grain size, water content, carbon and nitrogen content), and biotic measures (e.g. canopy coverage, woody debris, number of trees, leaf litter) were also taken. Despite complete canopy loss, total crab abundance has not changed significantly (in contrast to biomass) and all 12 species found in the forest were also found in the gaps, demonstrating their robustness. Another 9 gap-exclusive species were recorded and average species number and Shannon diversity were thus higher in the gaps. Perisesarma eumolpe was the most abundant species, both in the forest and in the gaps, and a shift from sesarmids (typical forest species) to ocypodids (generally more prominent in open areas) has not occurred. The persistence of litter-feeding sesarmid crabs prior to the re-establishment of a mangrove canopy is likely to depend on the availability of woody debris on the ground of the gaps, fuelling a mangrove detritus based food web, rather than one based on microphytobenthos and deposit-feeding ocypodids. The presence of burrowing crabs in the gaps suggests that important ecosystem engineering activities are still performed. However, bioturbation may be reduced as crab biomass and body size were smaller in the gaps. Follow-up assessments and field experiments are needed to understand the crabs' role in processing the woody debris, their long-term community dynamics and possible feed-backs between species shifts and gap regeneration.

AB  - Several decapod groups independently colonized freshwater and terrestrial habitats and became independent from the sea. These invasions were accompanied by analogous reproductive and developmental traits such as large eggs and an abbreviated, lecithotrophic development. Here, we present the first empirical study on the evolution of reproductive and developmental traits that accompany the invasion of land by crabs. As crucial steps in the colonization, we identify the transitions of the larval nursery, first, from the marine plankton into landlocked-brackish nurseries and, second, into fresh water. During these invasions, the early life-cycle stages were facing new ecological conditions and selective agents. We test hypotheses on the evolution of egg size and the mode of development in relation to the larval ecology of recent species and draw conclusions on their evolutionary past. As a model we focus on the genus Sesarma, that colonized Jamaica relatively recently and comprises species with a larval development in marine, brackish and freshwater habitats. In addition, we compare representatives of the crab genera Armases, Sesarma and Uca that invaded brackish-nursery habitats independently. The analysis reveals that in each genus the transition from marine to brackish nurseries resulted in fewer and larger eggs, an abbreviated development and higher endotrophic potential of larvae, and a wider tolerance to physicochemical stress (salinity). Size at metamorphosis, however, did not change in brackish species, suggesting that it is constrained. Within the Sesarma-lineage, egg size increases considerably from marine to freshwater species. The duration of embryonic development, the size and endotrophic potential of larvae are positively correlated, but the duration of the larval phase is negatively correlated with egg size. Hypotheses suggesting that large eggs evolved as a response to limited food or intense predation are inadequate to explain the initial egg-size increase in brackish species. We suggest that the specific abiotic environment of the brackish nurseries ultimately selected for increased egg size. These particular larval nurseries of brackish species of Armases, Sesarma and Uca are nutrient rich but ephemeral habitats with unfavourable physicochemical conditions, which strongly favour a swift larval phase and possibly large body size and higher salinity- stress resistance of larvae. The reason for the further and substantial increase in egg size in freshwater species remains unknown. The 'food-limitation' hypothesis derived from laboratory experiments, however, is inadequate to explain this increase. Our results support general life-history hypotheses ('safe harbour' hypothesis) that predict the evolution of large eggs if postembryonic stages face high risk of mortality, but not the predicted positive relationship between egg size and instantaneous egg stage mortality. On the contrary, we find a negative relationship, suggesting that larger eggs are a 'safer harbour' than smaller eggs. We outline a scenario for the invasion of land by crabs and propose a two-step model: as a first step, an instant shift of the larval development from offshore into landlocked-brackish nurseries, and, as a second step, from there into freshwater nurseries.

AB  - Crab larvae were collected from a platform moored in the mouth of a mangrove estero (= tidal creek) in the Gulf of Nicoya on the Pacific coast of Costa Rica, Central America. Eight observation periods encompassed both spring and neap tides and covered all season of the year. During each observation period, samples were collected every 2 h over 5 consecutive tidal cycles. Samples were collected from a depth of 1 m with a gasoline-powered impeller pump; total volume of each sample was 10 to 12 m3. The gross taxonomic composition of the observed larval assemblage was similar to that seen in temperate estuaries along the Atlantic coast of North America. Larvae of Uca spp., Grapsidae, Xanthidae and commensal crabs such as Pinnotheres spp. were the most common. However, abundance of individual taxa was greater than that seen in temperate estuaries with common forms in excess of 1000 larvae m-3. In contrast to temperate estuaries, spawning occurred year-round, but individual taxa showed distinct seasonality. As in temperate estuaries, spawing in the estero was also influenced by lunar cycles and larvae of several taxa showed tidally rhythmic changes in abundance. Zoea I of Uca spp., Grapsidae, Xanthidae, Pinnotheres spp. and Petrolisthes spp. were significantly more abundant during ebb tides suggesting that these larvae were spawned in the creek and exported to the open Gulf. Advanced zoea and megalopae appeared to take advantage of nocturnal flood tides to be recruited back into the estuary. Export of early stages did not occur in all taxa. Abundance of early zoeal stages of Pinnixa spp. was not affected by tidal phase suggesting that early stages were not exported from the estero.

AB  - Transport of crab zone, megalopae, and early juveniles was measured in a mangrove estero (creek) in the Gulf of Nicoya on the Pacific coast of Costa Rica. In 1987, larvae were collected by quantitative pumping from a platform moored in the mouth of the estero. During each sampling period, larvae were collected every 2 h over five consecutive tidal cycle. The investigation consisted of one spring-tide sampling period and one neap-tide sampling period during each season of the year (dry season, dry-rainy transition, rainy season, and rainy-dry transition). Hourly tidal heights were available for each sampling period. A model for hindcasting tidal volume flux from the change in sea level over each half tidal cycle was developed from measurements made in the estero in 1989. This model was used to calculate tidal volume flux and consequent larval flux during each of the 1987 sampling periods. There was a net export of zoea stage I of four taxonomic groups (Uca, spp., Pinnotheres spp., Petrolistes spp., and Grapsidae) during most sampling periods, while there was a net import of zoea stage I of only two groups (Pinnixa spp., and Xanthidae). Intermediate and late zoeal stages of all taxonomic groups were generally imported into the estero, as were megalopal and juvenile stages. Quantitative estimates of net larval transport corroborated earlier qualitative models of larval transport that had been based on observations of the vertical distribution of larvae in the water column.

AB  - We used a combination of field and laboratory techniques to examine the relative importance of food webs based on marsh detritus, benthic algae, or phytoplankton in supporting growth of the blue crab Callinectes sapidus. We conducted a laboratory experiment to compare the growth of newly metamorphosed juveniles fed natural diets from potential settlement habitats such as marshes. The experimental diets consisted of zooplankton, Uca pugnax and Littoraria irrorata tissue, a mixture of plant detritus and associated meiofauna and detritus only. Crabs fed the zooplankton diet showed the fastest growth and reached a mean dry weight of 32.4 mg, from an initial dry weight of 0.8 mg, during a 3 wk period. Based on the isotopic composition, juvenile crabs obtain carbon and nitrogen from various food sources. For example, crabs fed zooplankton obtained their nutrition from phytoplankton-derived organic matter, consistent with zooplankton feeding on phytoplankton. The mean delta13C values for juveniles fed detritus and detritus-plus-meiofauna were considerably lighter (delta13C = -19permill), than that of their respective diets (delta13C = -16permill), suggesting that crabs were selectively ingesting prey items that obtain their nutrition from an isotopically lighter carbon source like phytoplankton. Conversely, crabs fed U. pugnax or L. irrorata had isotopic ratios (delta13C = -16 to -14permill) consistent with these species feeding on isotopically heavier marsh grass carbon. Isotopic ratios of crabs collected in the field appeared to corroborate the experiment and suggest that either Spartina alterniflora detritus or benthic algae-based food webs supported juvenile crab growth in marsh environments, whereas phytoplankton-based food webs dominate habitats more closely associated with the main estuary.

AB  - Larvae of 15 species or genera of crabs were collected and identified during a six month (May 26 to October 28, 1978) study in the mouth of Delaware Bay. Seasonal abundance and vertical distribution of each species were investigated. Most species studied had peak abundance in July and August except for Cancer irroratus and Ovalipes ocellatus which showed peak occurrence in May and June, respectively. Larvae of species strongly dependent on estuarine habitats, such as Uca spp., Pinnixa chaetopterana, and P. sayana, showed a tendency to congregate in near-bottom waters where net flow of water is landward, thus favoring retention within the estuary. Larvae of Ovalipes ocellatus, Cancer irroratus, and Callinectes sapidus were more common at the surface. This vertical distribution suggests that these larvae are flushed out of the estuary. The mechanisms of recruitment and replenishment of adult populations within the estuary would therefore depend on migration of megalopa and juveniles.

AB  - The effects of burrows on the infaunal community in a tropical tidal flat were studied on the northeast coast of Australia. A comparative survey of infauna in burrows versus adjacent sediment was carried out for the burrows of 3 crustaceans (Scopimera inflata, Uca spp., Callianassa australiensis) and a brachiopod (Lingula anatina). More (1.5 to 2.5x) infauna occurred within burrows than in adjacent sediments. Densities of meiobenthic nematodes, copepods and Platyhelminthes were significantly higher within the burrows of Uca spp., C. australiensis and L. anatina. In the latter 2 cases multivariate analyses showed distinct communities in burrows and adjacent sediment, although this was not consistent over time for the brachiopod burrows. No differences in community composition were detected in the cases of Uca spp. and S. inflata. In a field experiment, C. australiensis was excluded from 7 sites, and infaunal abundances and species compositions were followed for 1 yr and compared with control sites. From the very beginning, meiofaunal densities were significantly lower in the exclusion sites, mainly due to reduced densities of nematodes and copepods. The effect of the shrimp exclusion on macrofauna was less pronounced, but after 1 yr total numbers of macrofauna were significantly lower in the exclusions, due to the distribution of amphipods. The results showed that promotive interactions play an important role in structuring tropical tidal flat communities.

AB  - The Cangio mangrove area is a large coastal area. Initial results have identify 49 species of Brachyura, among them there are 2 freshwater species that immigrated from terrestrial area: Ranguna bousmichei and Ranguna longipes. Some species of the Ocypodidae family are dominant in mangrove. The distribution of Brachyura: almost Grapsidae are found in the inner of mangrove forest; Ocypodidae are outside of the forest and some places without mangrove trees. The distribution features of Brachyura are dependent on characteristics of different biotopes. Dominating on the outer of mangrove forest is the genus Uca; on the mangrove ground is the genus Sesarma and some species of Macrophthalmus are dominant at the low tide area, near the streams and canals and at mud surfaces. Up to now, some species of Ocypodidae have been found only in the South of Vietnam.

AB  - A NEW FIDDLER CRAB (GENUS UCA, OCYPODIDAE,) FROM THE PLIO-PLEISTOCENE FROM THE PACIFIC COAST OF HONDURAS. The first fossils crabs from Honduras assigned to Uca Leach, 1814 (Brachyura, Ocypodidae) taken at Cedeno (Choluteca region) on the Pacific slope around the Gulf of Fonseca are described. Although Uca are common estuarine crustaceans with similar to 100 extant species across the globe, their fossil record is extremely scarce with only five described taxa. Moreover, these descriptions are based on very fragmentary fossils with poor diagnostic features. On the basis of fourteen silicified specimens, Uca (Uca) marinae sp. nov. is described here. With a large, flattened major cheliped, the new species is most likely related to the extant species Uca ornata, U. maracoani and U. insignis. Farther analysis indicates that the phylogenetic positions of both the new species as well as U. antiqua (Miocene, Northern Brazil) are relatively close to U. ornata. Biogeographic, ethologic, and ecologic interpretations imply that the last common ancestor for the extant forms, Uca ornata, U. maraconai and U. insignis, and the extinct congeners, U. marinae and U. antique, had a Pan-American distribution prior to the early Miocene and experienced at least two vicariance events. The most recent probably occurred after the closing of the trans-Panamanian seaway during the Plio-Pleistocene separating U. insignis and U. maracoani. During an earlier era, another event created a lineage stemming from an ancestor of U. ornata.

AB  - Fractionation of 1000 Uca pugilator eyestalks by a combination of gel filtration on Sephadex G-25 and successive ion exchange chromatography on CM- and DEAE-cellulose resulted in the isolation of two major peaks of melanophore-dispersing activity which were designated MDH-1 and MDH-2. These hormones coeluted on Sephadex G-25 superfine, but showed distinct elution profiles on CM-cellulose. The homogeneity of MDH-1 was determined in two different paper chromatography and paper electrophoresis systems. In these systems a single fluorescamine-positive spot comigrated with MDH activity. N-Terminal analysis of MDH-1 by the dansyl-Cl procedure resulted in the identification of aspartic acid at this position. MDH-1 stimulated pigment dispersion in melanophores and leucophores in an identical manner, and in both systems a dose of 30 ng/small mu, Greekl caused a half-maximal response.

AB  - Melanophore-dispersing activity was isolated from head extracts of the orthopteran Periplaneta americana and the hymenopteran Apis mellifera. Partial purification of the P. americana extracts indicated two peaks of activity which were designated PCF-1 and PCF-2. These factors were water-soluble, heat-stable, trypsin-sensitive polypeptides with apparent molecular weights of 3500 and 1000 daltons, respectively. Both factors were distributed throughout the central nervous system of P. americana, but neither factor was detected in the corpora cardiaca-corpora allata complex of this species. Cardiac excitatory activity was found to coelute with the PCF-2 peak on Sephadex G-25 and this activity also was trypsin sensitive. The melanophore-dispersing factor isolated from A. mellifera (ACF) was a 20,000-dalton, water-soluble, methanol-insoluble, trypsin-sensitive, temperature- and oxidation-sensitive polypeptide.

AB  - Planktonic larvae of decapod crustaceans were collected monthly from July 1991 to June 1992 by pumping during nocturnal hood and ebb tides to establish seasonal larval abundance patterns in an inlet of the Bay of Cadiz. Additional 24 h series of samples were collected seasonally (July 1991, October 1991, January 1992 and May/June 1992) during spring and neap tides to analyse larval abundance in relation to the main environmental cycles (diel, tidal and lunar phases) and vertical position in the water column. First zoeae were the most abundant stage for most species, representing 97.6% of all individuals collected. Zoea I abundance was higher in spring and summer and, on most sampling occasions, there was a net output from the inlet to the bay. Five species (Liocarcinus arcuatus and Liocarcinus vernalis, Uca tangeri, Diogenes pugilator and Panopeus afficanus) represented 60% of total individuals caught. The seasonal occurrence of first zoeae of the most abundant species indicated two different reproductive patterns: species with a short reproductive period and species spawning year round. Zoea I of several species (Panopeus africanus, Uca tangeri, Pachygrapsus marmoratus, Processa spp.) were significantly more abundant during ebb tides and their later larval stages were scarcely collected, suggesting that these larvae are released in the inlet and exported to the bay. Conversely, a net input of first zoeae was observed for other species (D.pugilator and Pinnotheres pinnotheres), but their later larval stages were also scarcely collected. Such importation could be a larval rhythm artifact due to release of larvae in the bay that drifted into the inlet by tidal currents. The crab Ilia nucleus, whose later larval stages were collected frequently, was the only species that seemed to complete its life cycle within the bay. These results suggest that the studied inlet was primarily used by decapods as an adult habitat and spawning ground, while larval development occurred in open sea. Since vertical migration was not observed for exported larvae, the tidal synchronization of female release seemed to be the most probable mechanism of larval exportation. There were no significant differences between larval release during spring and neap tides.

AB  - Burrowing crabs of the genus Uca inhabit tidal mudflats and beaches. They feed actively during low tide and remain in their burrows when the tide is high. The timing of this activity has been shown to persist in the absence of external light and tidal cues, indicating the presence of an internal timing mechanism. Researchers report the persistence of several variations in locomotor activity under laboratory conditions that cannot be explained by a single circatidal clock. Previous studies supported two alternative hypotheses: the presence of either two circalunidian clocks, or a circadian and circatidal clock to regulate these activity rhythms. In this paper, we formulate mathematical models to describe and test these hypotheses. The models suggested by the literature contain some important differences beyond the frequency of proposed clocks, and these are reflected in the mathematical formulations and simulation results. One hypothesis suggests independent phase oscillators, while the other hypothesis suggests that they are coupled in anti-phase. Neither model is able to recover all of the variations in locomotor acitivity observed under laboratory conditions. However, we propose a new model that incorporates aspects of both existing hypotheses and is able to reproduce all laboratory observations. (Author correspondence: verzi@math.sdsu.edu)

AB  - Field experiments with the mosquito adulticide fenthion (Baytex((R))) compared the conventional flat-fan nozzle system (Tee Jet 8002SS) and a new high-pressure hollow-cone nozzle system (1/8 M1SS). Ground deposition and aerial flux of the mosquito adulticide fenthion were measured up to 4.83 km downwind by using filter paper and yarn collectors, respectively. Biological efficacy was investigated by using caged salt-marsh mosquitoes (Ochlerotatus taeniorhynchus), and caged fiddler crabs (Uca pugilator) were exposed to quantify nontarget impact. Peak deposits to the ground were 1,729 mug/m(2) and 240 mug/m(2) for the flat-fan nozzles and high-pressure cones, respectively. Deposits from the flat-fan nozzles resulted in a cumulative fiddler crab mortality of 80%, whereas no deaths were recorded with the high-pressure system. The range of fenthion flux detected in the air when using the yarn collectors was similar for the 2 systems, with both showing drift through 4.83 km. For the flat-fan spray nozzle system, the aerosol flux ranged from 3.02 to 67.33 mug/yarn collector. The range of aerosol flux for the high-pressure nozzle spray system was 0.15-50.66 mug/yarn collector. Although the 2 systems produced comparable ranges of flux, the high-pressure system provided higher control efficacy against mosquitoes. Maximum mosquito control when using the flat-fan spray nozzle system against female salt-marsh mosquitoes was 26.6%, whereas maximum control with the high-pressure spray system was 92.9%.

AB  - Two hydraulic spray nozzle systems, a flat fan and a high-pressure hollow cone, were used for ultra-low-volume application of the mosquito adulticide fenthion under a multiple swath scheme. Eight swaths at 322-m intervals were applied from a height of 91 in to simulate operational conditions. Deposition, effects on nontarget organisms (fiddler crabs), aerial flux, and mosquito (Ochlerotatus taeniorhynchus) mortality were monitored for 8,230 m downwind, including the area under all 8 swaths. The flat-fan nozzle system deposited 88 times the amount of fenthion deposited by the high-pressure system in a lightly vegetated zone directly beneath the application area (0-2,134 m). Further downwind (2,286-4,420 m) in the 2nd semiopen urban zone, 10.5 times more chemical was deposited with the flat-fan nozzles than with the high-pressure nozzles, and in the 3rd highly vegetated zone (4,572-8,230 m), 25 times more was deposited compared with high-pressure nozzles. The corresponding nontarget mortalities with the flat-fan nozzle were 80, 12, and 17% at 2,438, 3,658, and 4,572 m, respectively. No treatment-induced mortality was observed with high-pressure nozzles. Similar amounts of fenthion residue were recovered from yarn samples for both nozzle systems, with the exception of the zone directly under the flight paths, where the flat-fan system deposited 2.5 times the amount recovered with the high-pressure system. Mosquito mortality was similar between the 2 nozzle types except in the farthest zone, where the average mortalities for the high-pressure system and the flat-fan system were 73.4 and 34.8%, respectively. Regression analysis of the mosquito mortality and yarn samples showed that the high-pressure hollow-cone application could control mosquitoes with half the amount of chemical compared to flat-fan nozzles.

AB  - The abundance of the marsh clam Polymesoda caroliniana at four stations on a Mississippi tidal marsh was followed from February 1977 through April 1978. The stations varied with respect to inundation time and vegetative cover. The largest population was found in an area flooded 12% of the year (136 individuals per m2) and in an area flooded 3.2% of the year (126 individuals per m2). However, the latter area contained no large clams (>25.5 mm). Smaller populations were found in the upper reaches of a tidal creek draining the marsh (68 individuals per m2) and in an area flooded 5.8% of the year (73 individuals per m2). The average abundance of the clams on the marsh was 100 per m2. At least three recruitment periods were apparent. In laboratory studies, clams larger than 15 mm survived longer than 30 days without water. Clams smaller than 12 mm survived less than 6 days without water. Several decapods (Callinectes sapidus, Uca longisignalis, and Sesarma reticulatum) consumed clams smaller than 10 mm but were unable to eat larger clams under laboratory conditions. Polymesoda caroliniana may be important to the functioning of the marsh by removing large quantities of particulate matter from flooding water.

AB  - Crustaceans have the remarkable ability to regenerate limbs. Unlike insects, crustaceans also continue to increase in body size with age, and new limb regeneration must occur in concert with the growth and reproductive activities of the adult. In the fiddler crab, Uca pugilator, regeneration consists of the formation of a blastema (limb primordium) from cells migrating into the site of the wound. Over a time course related to the physiology and growth cycle of the animal, these cells proliferate and differentiate into an intact miniature limb, which will then increase in size and emerge as a functional appendage with the nest molting of the body exoskeleton In arthropods, changes in gene expression mediating both growth (e.g., cuticular molting) and differentiation (e.g., insect metamorphosis) are regulated by ecdysteroids. We hypothesize that ecdysteroids and their receptors are also involved in the regulation of limb regeneration in crabs. To investigate this hypothesis, clones representing the crustacean ecdysteroid receptor have been isolated and are providing the basis for the development of nucleic acid and immunological probes to identify, at the tissue level, the pattern of receptor expression relative to changes in hormone titer during all stages of regeneration. In support of this hypothesis, we have detected the expression of the nuclear receptor genes encoding the ecdysteroid receptor at the earliest stages of blastemal development. We hare also shown that receptor transcript synthesis can be influenced by external factors (retinoid exposure) which disrupt Uca blastemal differentiation. These studies allow us to identify and characterize putative ecdysteroid target tissues. They begin to address the goal of defining how a common signal (e.g, circulating hormones) can influence a variety of discrete developmental programs.

AB  - Using sequence information derived from the Drosophila melanogaster (Dm) ecdysteroid receptor (EcR)- and retinoid X receptor (RXR)-encoding gene homologs, we have isolated cDNA clones corresponding to the DNA-binding domains (DBD) for these two nuclear receptors from the fiddler crab, Uca pugilator (Up). Both genes appear to be represented in 1-2 copies in the Up genome, and unlike Dm, contain an intron within the DBD-encoding region. Sequence comparisons to the Dm EcR and RXR homologs indicate 76 and 82% nucleotide identity, respectively, corresponding to 6 and 4 single-amino acid substitutions which primarily cluster in the region of the molecule involved in dimerization. RT-PCR analysis indicates that both the EcR and RXR homologs are expressed during the initial stages of limb regeneration, temporally concomitant with early blastema formation and the secretion of a flexible sac cuticle at the site of limb loss.

AB  - We have constructed several directional and randomly-primed cDNA libraries from mRNAs isolated during progressive stages of fiddler crab (Uca pugilator) limb regeneration. Data from these libraries is being assembled into an on-line database (http://www.genome.ou.edu/crab) that is both BLAST and keyword searchable; the data set will also be available through GenBank. The first characterized library was made from mRNA isolated fours days post-autotomy, when the first sign of morphological differentiation, cuticle secretion, is observed. Analysis of approximately 1500 cDNA clones led to assignment of 485 contigs and 429 singlets, for a total of 914 sequences. Of these, approximately 63% showed no homology on database searching. Analysis of these unclassified sequences relative to sequencing with 5’ or 3’ specific primers showed approximately equal numbers in each category, suggesting that the ‘no hit’ clones may contain a large number of new genes. Biological assignments for the approximately 37% of ESTs based on KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) are broken down into metabolism or regulatory categories, and a detailed list of assignments based on the NCBI COG (Clusters of Othologous Groups) outline format is available. These ESTs include several genes that may be potentially ecdysteroid-responsive, such as homologs to chaperone proteins and cuticle protein genes. Homologs to arthropod proteins involved in retinoid/terpenoid metabolism have also been identified. To investigate potential ecdysteroid-responsive candidate genes, hormone induction experiments are currently in progress, using primer sets designed from database sequence information and quantitative real-time PCR.

BLAST searches to specific protein domains in the Gene Ontology database led to assignments for similar to 40% of the assembled sequences. Sequence similarity searches of other crustacean EST databases produced hits to 13-30% of the Uca query sequences. The ESTs include several genes that may be potentially ecdysteroid-responsive, such as homologs to chaperone proteins and cuticle protein genes, as well as homologs to arthropod proteins involved in retinoid/terpenoid metabolism. We have tested 3 potential candidate genes for their ability to be induced by ecdysteroid in limb bud explants; an arthropodial cuticle protein gene, and the nuclear receptor genes EcR and RXR. A subset of early blastemal limb buds (8 days post autotomy) show a positive response to ecdysteroid by 1-1.5 h, followed by a decrease in transcript abundance at longer periods of sustained incubation. Later stage buds (12 days post autotomy-late premolt) show decreases in steady-state mRNA levels by 1.5 h, or are completely refractory to ecdysteroid exposure.

AB  - A pilot study has generated approximately 1500 ESTs from a Uca pugilator (fiddler crab) blastemal tissue cDNA library made from mRNA isolated four days post-autotomy, from a period when the first sign of morphological differentiation, cuticle secretion, is observed. These include several genes that may be potentially ecdysteroid-responsive, such as homologs to chaperone proteins and cuticle protein genes, as well as homologs to arthropod enzymes involved in retinoid/terpenoid metabolism (e.g. farnesoic acid O methyl transferase; juvenile hormone esterase). One EST also shares high sequence similarity (46% identity and 55% chemical similarity) to vertebrate and invertebrate cytoplasmic retinoic acid binding proteins (CRABPs). A categorization of the EST library in terms of general biological assignments of function will be presented. A web site for this database has been established (http://www.genome.ou.edu/crab.html) providing both search capabilities and sequence information (via anonymous ftp) to the general scientific community. This pilot database will be expanded as more information is collected from other libraries. We envisage the eventual development of microarrays from this and similar databases that would have broad applications in studies of crustacean endocrine signaling mechanisms

AB  - We report here complete coding sequences for the Uca pugilator homologs of the ecdysteroid (UpEcR) and retinoid-X receptors (UpRXR). Library screenings recovered cDNA clones containing a unique amino terminal open-reading frame (A B domain) for each gene. most similar to insect B1 EcR and USP1/RXR isoforms. Splicing variants in the UpRXR ligand-binding domain were also identified. in a region critical for folding of Drosophila and lepidopteran USP. UpEcR and UpRXR proteins were able to associate. and both are required for binding to an ecdysteroid FIRE these interactions were not hormone-dependent. Ribonuclease protection assays (RPA) were conducted using A B domain and 'common' (C or E) domain probes on RNA isolated from various stages of regenerating limb buds and ovaries. For several of the limb bud and ovarian stages examined, the relative level of A B domain sequence protected. as significantly less than common domain Suggesting alternative amino terminal isoforms other than those isolated through cloning. This is the first report of UpEcR and UpRXR transcription during ovarian maturation, implicating the ovary as a potential target for hormonal control in Crustacea.

AB  - The sand fiddler crab Uca pugilator was used as a model to study the physiological regulation of feeding behavior. This study had 3 objectives: (1) to isolate and characterize feeding inhibitory factor (FIF); (2) to determine the physiological effects of the eyestalk factor, provide insight regarding its mechanism of action and relate this to known vertebrate feeding factors; and (3) to evaluate the effects of the eyestalk factor on the foraging patterns of U. pugilator in a mesocosm setting. FIF was localized to the sinus gland, the major neurosecretory system in crustaceans. Response to FIF is dose-dependent. Ultrafiltration and chromatography studies indicate that FIF is a low molecular weight peptide processed from a larger precursor molecule. FIF loses biological activity in a variety of organic solvents used in purification of other sinus gland peptides and does not appear to be species specific. Laboratory assays examined the physiological effects of FIF. Direct elevation of crab hemolymph glucose levels by injection of dextrose caused feeding inhibition in test crabs and the release of detectable levels FIF into the hemolymph 60min after injection. Elevation of hemolymph glucose levels by injection of crustacean hyperglycemic hormone did not cause feeding inhibition or release of FIF into the hemolymph. FIF did not affect hemolymph glucose levels. FIF does not appear to be a homolog of either of the vertebrate hormones cholecystokinin or insulin, but may be a cholecystokinin analog. Mesocosm experiments quantified large scale patterns of foraging and movement in relation to crab density. At low densities, injection of high levels of glucose caused crabs to remain in the upper portion of the intertidal, while injection of low levels stimulated movement to the low intertidal. At high densities, crabs generally remained in the same area of the intertidal. Further analysis of the data suggested that administration of FIF may have caused a significant decrease in crab feeding 60min after injection. Altogether, the results indicate that the physiological condition of individual crabs regulates responses to environmental conditions that lead to large-scale patterns of foraging behavior.

AB  - The mating strategies of male fiddler crabs are variable and highly flexible within species. In this study I examine three types of mating strategy used by individual male Uca vocans hesperaie. The most common strategy, termed a 'standard gambit', where males approached females at their burrow entrance and initiated courtship, accounted for 63% of mating attempts and 75% of successful matings. The rarest strategy (4% of mating attempts) was the 'dig out', where males attempted to mate with females whose burrows they had excavated. This strategy accounted for 19% of successful matings. 'Herding' behaviour which involved a male attempting to herd a female into a burrow and mate, contributed 33% of mating attempts but were generally unsuccessful, accounting for only 2.6% of successful matings. Males used more than one strategy during the study period. Smaller males used the standard gambit strategy more often than herding or dig outs while larger males used the herding strategy more often. There was no relationship between male size and mating success and males did not preferentially mate with females of a certain size. The predominant strategy adopted by males over the lunar cycle depended on female behaviour. Herding behaviour was induced by female wandering which escalated at full moon. Standard gambits were the commonest strategy adopted at and around new moon. The low success rate of male mating attempts (16%) indicates a reluctance by females to mate multiply. This may lead to conflict between the sexes because in fiddler crabs there is last male sperm precedence.

AB  - The present investigation was undertaken to examine some aspects of ovarian maturation and its regulation by the neuroendocrine system of the fiddler crab, Uca pugilator. In vivo studies in which extracts of thoracic ganglia were injected into intact and eyestalkless females, revealed the presence of OSH in Uca. Furthermore, OSH showed seasonal activity with regard to the annual reproductive cycle. Studies of the effect of OSH, OIH and cyclic AMP on protein synthesis in the ovary were conducted in vitro by an organ culture method. Eyestalk tissue and cAMP decreased radioactive leucine incorporation into newly synthesized protein in previtellogenic ovaries but had no effect on protein synthesis in maturing ovaries. The thoracic ganglion inhibited protein synthesis in both previtellogenic ovaries and maturing ovaries. A critical examination was made of the role of the ovary in the synthesis of yolk protein, vitellin. Maturing ovaries incorporated radioactive leucine into newly synthesized vitellin in vitro. Two subunits of vitellin were isolated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Their molecular weights are 77,700D and 87,700D. The electrophoretic profiles of hemolymph from crabs in various stages of ovarian development were determined under denaturing conditions. Two female-specific polypeptides were observed in the hemolymph of crabs undergoing vitellogenesis and those having mature ovaries. Neither one was present in males or females with previtellogenic ovaries. It appears then that females of Uca pugilator undergo both intraovarian and extraovarian yolk protein synthesis.

AB  - Pre-service teachers used invertebrates in an extended inquiry project during the class, Life Science for Elementary Teachers. Goals were that students 1) practice observation, questioning, posing explanations, and predicting outcomes of investigations and 2) positively change attitudes about invertebrates. We assessed the first goal using a Vee Map report of an investigation and the second using surveys of attitudes. Some students made observations, hypothesized explanations, and formed predictions based on hypotheses. For example, one team observed fiddler crabs hiding in shade, asked why the crabs did this, hypothesized that the crabs do not like light, and predicted that shining a light on a crab would cause movement. Too often, students did not constructively order science skills. Students formed unconnected observations, questions, hypotheses, and predictions, such as “Will mealworms migrate to their water source?” followed by “Mealworms move through cotton balls rather than around cotton balls.” Other students posed hypotheses very late in the project, such as concluding with the explanation: “We believe the mealworms changed their location so they could survive. Organisms must adapt to their environment to survive.” Some student attitudes improved. For instance, we doubled the percentage who would like a hermit crab as a pet and individuals developed new positions during this project. As a group, opinions stayed fairly constant. The most common stance, pre- and post-project, was that students did not mind looking at invertebrates, but only if contained. Encouragingly, over 80% of students planned to use animals in ongoing inquiry activities in the classroom. However, that attitude was not drastically affected by the project.

AB  - Haustorius arenarius and Nerine cirratulus in the sands, in the estuary and Uca tangeri in consolidated sediments, Corophium volutator in muddy sand, Paragnathia formica in micro cliff mud and Spartina maritima in muddy sand and mud characterize the indicatory units of compact sediments which are euryhyaline and nontolerant to wave actions. As for the infralittoral units, the localization, ecological conditions, composition of species and stability of the biotope and accompanying fauna of each unit were analyzed. A synecological interpretation is given, based on the analysis of the ecological conditions and on the accompanying fauna of each unit.

AB  - Three breeding trends were observed in mangrove grapsids and ocypodids from Mgazana. First, significant changes were found from continuous breeding in the low shore (Macrophthalmus grandidieri) to seasonal breeding on the middle to high shore (Uca and Sesarma spp.). The higher on the intertidal a species occurred, the larger the crab and the more defined the breeding season (Sesarma meinerti). Small species (M. grandidieri) have adopted a strategy of continuous breeding to maximize reproductive output. The second pattern was a staggering of spawning peaks among seasonal breeders with increasingly later peaks the higher the crabs occurred on the shore. Sesarma catenata commenced breeding in August, while the high intertidal species Uca lactea annulipes was ovigerous in March. The third trend was a sharp decline in breeding activity in autumn (March) when temperatures dropped. For the grapsids and Uca vocans hesperiae, sex ratio peaks declined during ovigerous periods. With the exception of M. grandidieri and S. meinerti, there were significantly more males than females. Breeding periodicity may be controlled by a combination of factors, including latitude, temperature, food availability (both adult and larval), and intertidal zonation. Larval interspecific competition in coexisting guilds (Sesarma and Uca) could be minimized by staggering egg-bearing peaks, with breeding delayed and more defined higher on the intertidal.

AB  - For a full understanding of prey availability, it is necessary to study risk-taking behaviour of the prey. Fiddler crabs are ideally suited for such a study, as they have to leave their safe burrow to feed on the surface of the intertidal flats during low tide, thereby exposing themselves to avian predators. A study in an intertidal area along the coast of Mauritania showed that small crabs always stayed in the vicinity of their burrow, but large crabs wandered in large flocks (also referred to as droves) to feed on sea-grass beds downshore. Transplanting downshore feeding substrate to the burrowing zone of the small crabs proved that they too preferred to feed on it. Since small crabs can be preyed upon by more species of birds, this suggests that the decision not to leave the burrowing zone might be related to the risk of being fed upon by birds. We calculated predation risk from measurements on the density and feeding activity of the crabs, as well as the feeding density, the intake rate and the size selection of the avian predators. Per hour on the surface, crabs in a flock were more at risk than crabs feeding near their burrow. Thus, though flocking crabs may have benefited from 'swamping the predator' by emerging in maximum numbers during some tides only, this did not reduce their risk of predation below that of non-flocking crabs. Furthermore we found that irrespective of activity, large crabs suffered a higher mortality per tide from avian predators than small crabs. This suggests that large crabs could not sufficiently reduce their foraging time to compensate for the increased risk while foraging in a flock, even though they probably experienced better feeding conditions than small crabs staying near their burrow. The greater energy demands of large crabs were reflected in a greater surface area grazed. Thus, with increasing size a fiddler crab has to feed further away from its burrow and so may derive less protection from staying near to it. It seems that growing big does not reduce the risk of predation for fiddler crabs, as it does in many other species with indeterminate growth. As in such species, the most probable advantage of growing big is increased mating success. Ultimately, therefore, prey availability must be understood from the life-history decisions of the prey species.

AB  - We compare larval distributions of the invasive Asian shore crab Hemigrapsus sanguineus and the native fiddler crab Uca pugnax. Our study was conducted in the coastal ocean adjacent to Delaware Bay on the east coast of the United States. Subtidal circulation in the study area is dominated by the Delaware Coastal Current, which is formed by the estuarine plume that extends southward out of the bay and along the inner continental shelf. The offshore edge of the current is marked by a strong density front and by convergent circulation along the frontal boundary. Surface plankton tows were taken at fine-scale intervals along saw-tooth transects traversing the front on 3 consecutive days in early August. Coincident physical measurements delivered hydrographic data throughout the investigation. Results provided a synoptic view of larval distribution near the bay mouth and showed patchy occurrence of the 2 species within the sampling area. Approximately 8.7x10(5) U. pugnax larvae were collected during the study, compared with 2.5x10(4) H. sanguineus. Analysis of spatial distribution with respect to the coastal current showed a marked difference between early-and late-stage larvae for each species. Zoea stage I larvae were most common in the main stream of the coastal current. In contrast, the distribution of advanced stages was skewed toward the frontal region. Larvae entrained in the frontal circulation are likely retained near Delaware Bay, whereas those in the main stream of the coastal current may undergo long-distance transport along the continental shelf.

AB  - This paper presents the results of field studies on the physiology, ecology and behaviour of 2 species of crab from Avicennia marina mangrove near Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. One crab, the ocypodid Uca inversa inversa, occurs at the top of the eulittoral zone where it constructs burrows. Measurements of microclimate show that these burrows provide essential protection from environmental extremes. Burrow temperatures (air and sediment) were consistently lower and less variable than sediment surface temperatures or air temperatures just above the sediment. Crab body temperature closely followed burrow temperature. When out of the burrow, evaporative cooling maintained body temperature lower than that of the surrounding air. The relative humidity of burrow air was consistently higher than that outside and the burrows provided a necessary source of standing water. Crab heart rate was monitored in order to assess physiological stress. The grapsid Metopograpsus messor occurs throughout the mangrove and makes strategic use of the mangrove vegetation in order to minimize the effects of thermal stress, though some crabs opportunistically utilize burrows. M. messor appears to be more vulnerable to thermal stress than U. inversa.

AB  - The effects of temperature on aspects of the respiratory physiology of two semi-terrestrial crabs, Uca inversa and Metopograpsus messor have been studied. When exposed to increasing temperatures in the laboratory both species show a pronounced increase in both the rate of oxygen consumption (Mo-2) and in heart rate; Q(10) values were approximately 2-3 over the temperature range 15-40 degrees C for both Mo-2 and heart rate. Temperature did not, however, affect the relationships between Mo-2 and fresh body weight and between heart rate and fresh body weight. The haemocyanin of both species was found to have a high oxygen affinity (P-50 = 6.4 and 12.4 Torr for U. inversa and M. messor, respectively, pH = 7.9, temperature = 30 degrees C) and moderately high Bohr values (-1.07 and -0.96 for U. inversa and M. messor, respectively). An increase in temperature resulted in a significant decrease in the oxygen affinity of the haemocyanin of both species (Delta H = -51.7 and -57.4 kJ.mol(-1) for U. inversa and M. messor, respectively). Changes in temperature did not have a significant effect on either the Bohr value or the cooperativity of the pigment.

AB  - 1. Measurements of the blood Na concentration and transepithelial electrical potential (T.E.P.) across Uca pugilator acclimated to sea water indicate that Na is maintained out of electrochemical equilibrium with sea water. The resulting net Na influx as well as the sodium gain due to ingestion of the medium must be balanced by extrarenal Na extrusion. 2. The small T.E.P. (-0.7 mV) and the 'transport numbers' of Na and Cl indicate that the permeability to these ions is equivalent. 3. Removal of external K results in a significant stimulation of unidirectional Na efflux that is dependent upon external Na but is not inhibited by ouabain. 4. Transfer of Uca to K and Na-free sea water results in a 54% decline in unidirectional efflux, which is not due to T.E.P. changes. Readdition of 25mM-K stimulates Na efflux much more than can be accounted for by changes in the T.E.P. Readdition of 25mM-Na to potassium-free sea water does not change the Na efflux. 5. The results indicate that Na extrusion by Uca is via a Na/K exchange mechanism which partially inhibits Na/Na exchange. Cessation of Na/K exchange (in K-free sea water) removes this inhibition and allows rapid Na/Na exchange. It is not known whether Na/K and Na/Na exchange are via the same or parallel carrier systems.

AB  - The vertical and horizontal distribution of two burrowing mud crabs, Uca tangeri Eydoux (1935) (Ocypodidae) and Ocypode cursor Linne 1758 (Ocypodidae) are described for the Bonny Estuary (7 degrees 00' E: 4 degrees 20' N), S. Nigeria. Substratum preference is the most prominent factor influencing distribution, but lack of tolerance to low salinities (< 6 parts per thousand) is also important, and prevents Ocypode cursor from occurring close to freshwater. The two species have slightly different sediment organic content and grade size requirements. Ocypode cursor was concentrated in well drained sandy sediment above mid-tide-level, whilst Uca tangeri was found in water-logged areas slightly above and below Mid-tide-level. This vertical demarcation is attributed to differential feeding and burrowing adaptations related to different substrata, rather than to differential tolerances to desiccation.

AB  - The impacts of simulated Nigerian light crude oil on mud flat periwinkles, Tympanotonus fuscata (L.), and fiddler crabs, Uca tangeri (Eydoux, 1935) was examined through field experiments conducted in the Bonny estuary of the Niger Delta (southern Nigeria). The purpose was to assess the fate and effects of a known quantity of the Nigerian light crude oil on this environment. Drastic changes in the densities of T. fuscata and U. tangeri observed immediately after spills was attributed to the effects of the oil. A large increase in Uca biomass occurred in the affected area. Salinity and temperature in the study area showed little fluctuations throughout the survey. Sediment characteristics were similar for all sites (stations). Grain-size analysis revealed that sediments at the study area were 70% silt. Migration of oil via tidal percolation was observed as much as 11 cm beneath the sediment surface.

AB  - A novel chymotrypsin-like serine protease (CLSP) was isolated from the hepatopancreas of the redclaw crayfish Cherax quadricarinatus (Cq-chy). The full-length cDNA of Cq-chy contains 951 nucleotides encodes a peptide of 270 amino acids. The mature peptide comprising 223 amino acids contains the conserved catalytic triad (H, D, and S). Similarity analysis showed that Cq-chy shares high identity with chymotrypsins from the fiddler crab; Uca pugilator. Cq-chy mRNA expression in C. quadricarinatus was shown to be: (a) tissue-related with the highest expression in the hepatotpancreas and widely distributed, (b) highly responsive in the hepatopancreas to White Spot Syndrome Virus (WSSV) challenge, and (c) differently regulated in immature and adult crayfish. In this study we successfully isolated Cq-chy. Our observations indicate that Cq-chy is differently involved in the immature and adult innate immune reactions, thus suggesting a role for CLSPs in the invertebrate innate immune system.

AB  - In most taxa, owners win fights when defending a territory against intruders. We calculated effect sizes for four factors that potentially contribute to an 'owner advantage'. We studied male fiddler crabs Uca mjoebergi, where owners won 92% of natural fights. Owners were not more successful because they were inherently better fighters (r = 0.02). There was a small effect (r=0.18) of the owner's knowledge of territory quality (food availability) and a medium effect (r = 0.29) of his having established relations with neighbours (duration of active tenure), but neither was statistically significant. There was, however, a significant effect due to the mechanical advantage the owner gained through access to the burrow during fights (r=0.48, p < 0.005).

AB  - Most nearshore brachyuran crabs of the northern Gulf of Mexico have been treated as conspecifics of those in warm-temperate Carolinian waters on the southeastern Atlantic coast of North America. However, historical physiographic constraints appear to have periodically restricted gene flow between northern Gulf populations and sibling Atlantic coast populations, and contemporary disjuncture of ranges often persists across south Florida. The present examination of intertidal complexes has centered on grapsid crabs presently assigned to Sesarma reticulatum and ocypodid crabs assigned to Uca minax, 2 species in which we have observed marked variations in coloration over their distributional range. Genetic differentiation between populations has been assayed by allozyme electrophoresis, and resultant data have been evaluated with F-statistics and cluster analysis of genetic distance. Allozyme divergence between Gulf and Atlantic populations of the S. reticulatum complex is at levels previously reported for speciated populations, while that between trans-Floridian populations of U. minax is much less pronounced. In both species, minimal divergence can be measured between 2 widely separated Atlantic coast sample localities that were compared, while more complex grades of differentiation are evident between sample localities compared within the northern Gulf of Mexico. Trans-Floridian divergence of populations for both of these species is compatible with models for periods of contact and subsequent isolation of Gulf and Atlantic stocks during and since peak glacial advances in North America. Less conspicuous patterns of genetic differentiation between sample localities within the northern Gulf of Mexico may reflect a history of glacial and postglacial alluvial events which resulted in contemporary physiography of nor-them Gulf estuaries.

AB  - Since 1965 large areas of lower Connecticut River tidelands have been converted from high diversity brackish meadow and Typha angustifolia marsh to near monocultures of Phragmites australis. This study addresses the impact of Phragmites invasion on fish and crustacean use of oligohaline high marsh. During spring tides from early June through early September 2000, fishes and crustaceans leaving flooded marsh along 3 km of the Lieutenant River, a lower Connecticut River tributary, were captured with Breder traps at 90 sites, equally distributed among Phragmites, Typha, and treated (herbicide and mowing) Phragmites areas. Pit traps, 18 per vegetation type in 2000 and 30 each in Phragmites and Typha in 2001, caught larvae and juveniles at distances of up to 30 m into the marsh interior. There were no significant differences in fish species compositions or abundances among the vegetation types. Size distributions, size specific biomasses, and diets of Fundulus heteroclitus, the numerically dominant fish, were also similar. The shrimp Palaemovetes pugio was more abundant in Phragmites than in other types of vegetation, whereas the fiddler crab Uca minax was least numerous in Phragmites. Mean numbers of E heteroclitus and P pugio caught per site event were positively correlated with increasing site hydroperiod. Significantly more F heteroclitus were captured along the upper reach of the river where marsh elevations were lower than farther downstream. More E heteroclitus and fewer P pugio and U. minax were captured during the day than at night. A relatively small number of larval and juvenile Fundulus sp. were captured in pit traps, but consistently fewer in Phragmites than in Typha, suggesting that Typha and brackish meadow marshes may provide better nursery habitat. Vegetation was sampled along a 30 m transect at each trap site in 2000. Plant species diversity was greatest in treated Phragmites areas and lowest in Phragmites sites.

AB  - Methyl farnesoate (MF) produced by the mandibular organ is a crustacean terpenoid hormone involved in the regulation of larval development, reproduction and male morphogenesis. But the receptor for MF has remained unresolved. In view of the fact that MF can bind to crustacean retinoid X receptor (RXR) and that the terpenoid mimic, pyriproxyfen, is capable of altering the expression of crustacean RXR gene, crustacean RXR has been proposed to be a candidate receptor for MF. It is well known that ecdysteroids signal through the ecdysteroid receptor (EcR), which heterodimerizes with the RXR in Crustacea. This study was aimed to investigate whether the exogenous MF impacts ecdysteroid signaling in vivo using N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase (NAG) mRNA from epidermal tissue as a biomarker for ecdysteroid signaling. The NAG mRNA from the model crustacean Uca pugilator injected with 0, 0.2, 1, 5, and 20 ng/g wet weight of MF was quantified using quantitative real-time PCR (gRT-PCR). An assay of epidermal NAG activity in crabs injected with 0, 20, and 2000 ng/g wet weight of MF was also performed. The administration of the exogenous MF was found to have no effects on epidermal NAG gene transcription or NAG activity in U. pugilator. These results clearly show that MF is not capable of affecting epidermal ecdysteroid signaling in the fiddler crab. U. pugilator. Our data are not supportive of the notion that MF signals through the RXR in Crustacea. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The emergence of the Isthmus of Panama subdivided the amphi-American biota. In the present study; Pacific and Atlantic populations of four cognate pairs of crabs were used to discern whether exposure to different thermal regimes in habitats, in the putative absence of gene flow, has resulted in physiological divergence. Populations that potentially form a common genetic pool were also used; these were populations of the Atlantic Panama cognate that occur in belize and Florida. Decreases in water temperature occur periodically in Pacific Panama and Florida, but nor in Atlantic Panama or Belize. In this study, physiological divergence in oxygen uptake was assessed in response to repeated exposure to either control and decreased temperature or control and increased temperature. Results indicate that, in only some of the genera tested, exposure to decreases in habitat temperature has resulted in divergence. Partial support is found for the corollary that adaptation to an environment with periods of decreased temperature results in reduced compensation during exposure to elevated temperature.

AB  - When the Isthmus of Panama emerged as a land bridge, it set the stage for allopatric speciation in the marine fauna. In the present study Pacific and Atlantic populations of three cognate pairs of crabs were used to discern whether physiological divergence has occurred as a result of exposure to different thermal regimes in habitats and in the putative absence of gene flow. Additional comparison was made with Belize and Florida populations of the Atlantic Panama cognate. This was done to test the strength of correlation between physiological divergence and exposure to different thermal regimes in populations that potentially form a common genetic pool. Water temperatures decrease periodically in Pacific Panama and Florida but not in Atlantic Panama or Belize. Physiological divergence in volume and ion regulation was assessed in response to repeated exposure to either control and decreased temperature or to control and increased temperature. Results indicate that exposure to naturally occurring decreased temperatures in habitats has resulted in divergence. This divergence is demonstrated both in enhanced ability to regulate volume at decreased temperature and impaired ability to regulate volume at elevated temperature.

AB  - Solid-phase analysis was undertaken to obtain information on the effects of bioturbation (activity of plants and macrofauna) on the distribution of different forms of iron and sulfur in a mangrove ecosystem in Brazil. A seasonal study involving four compartments from a mangrove forest (UN: an unvegetated mudflat: SP: a low intertidal zone colonized by Spartina alterniflora; RH: monospecific forest of Rhizophora mangle and; AV: monospecific forest of Avicennia schauerianna) was carried out. Pyrite-Fe, oxyhydroxides-Fe, acid volatile sulfide (AVS), degree of pyritization (DOP), pH and Eh were determined. The results show an intense effect of mangrove vegetation on soil redox processes. Higher live root densities (56-132 g m(-2)) in surface layers (0- 10 cm) from vegetated sites led to suboxic/oxic conditions (129-374 mV), pyrite oxidation, and acidic (3.8-5.5) conditions, showing the role of plant activity on iron sulfide biogeochemistry. The combination of more oxidizing conditions and pyrite oxidation process also favored oxyhydroxide precipitation, as indicated by higher values of oxyhydroxides-Fe found in superficial layers. In contrast, vegetated zones presented higher values of pyrite-Fe than UN, indicating that root exudades may stimulate the activity of sulfate-reducing bacteria. The results show a clear seasonal variation in AVS and pyritic fractions. In summer, the elevated temperatures cause higher evapotranspiration rates and plant activity which intensified the oxidation of iron sulfides. Thus, at all sites the AVS and pyrite-Fe values were substantially lower during summer (especially in superficial layers). A clear seasonal pattern was also observed in the unvegetated mudflat compartment. The lowest pyrite-Fe, DOP and AVS values, observed in summer, appear to be related to increased crab activity (Uca spp), probably because of more intense foraging and reproductive activity.

AB  - We examined potential fertility, egg volume, and water, lipid, and fatty acid content through embryogenesis in a population of female U. rapax from Sebastian Inlet, Florida. Carapace width (CW) ranged from 10.80 to 20.09 mm (N = 184), and each female carried 5000 to 30,000 eggs in the last stage of development. Female CW was found to be a good predictor of the number of eggs in the later stage of development (potential fertility = 7.908 CW2.7655, R-2 = 0.749). Egg volume increases (from 0.0079 to 0.0134 mm(3)) was mildly correlated (r = 0.79) with an increase in egg water content (from 60 to 69%). Egg lipid and fatty acid content decreased through embryogenesis, due to its importance as energy source. The most consumed fatty acids were the monounsaturated (97.81 mu g . mg dw(-1)) followed by the saturated (64.34 mu g . mg dw(-1)) and polyunsaturated (38.69 mu g . mg dw(-1)). Fatty acids 16:0, 18:2n-6, 16:1n-7, and 18:2n-6 are consumed preferentially (39.91, 38.45, 29.4 and 23.93 mu g . mg dw(-1), respectively), while essential polyunsaturated fatty acids, particularly docosahexaenoic acid (22:6n-3) and eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5n-3), are conserved. Egg fatty acid profile also reflects diet and habitat of adults. A medium-low EPA/DHA ratio suggests U. rapax occupies a medium trophic level. The low ratio (18:1n-7/18:1n-9) and high percentages of 18:1n-9 fatty acid (18%) and essential C-18 and C-20 polyunsaturated fatty acids (19-23%) suggests adults are omnivores consuming primary producers (like algae and mangrove leaves) and small invertebrates. The high percentage of odd-numbered fatty acids (above 3-3.5%) also suggests scavenger/detritivore behaviour.

AB  - Synthetic Pandalus red pigment-concentrating hormone was effective in concentrating the pigment in the erythrophores of the fiddler crab Uca pugilator and the dwarf crayfish Cambarellus shufeldti. However, this hormone had no effect on the melanophores of the crab or the leucophores of the crab and crayfish. These results are in accord with the hypothesis that in the fiddler crab and the dwarf crayfish, respectively, the hormonal control for each type of chromatophore is different.

AB  - Experiments done in this laboratory showed 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) stimulates gonadal maturation in male and female sand fiddler crabs, Uca pugilator, and red swamp crayfish, Procambarus clarkii. This action of 5-HT is indirect, 5-HT apparently stimulating release of the gonad-stimulating hormone (GSH) that is present in the brain and thoracic ganglia. For example, studies with ovarian explants showed 5-HT has no direct effect on the ovary. But, when ovarian explants were incubated with 5-HT and brain or thoracic ganglia, the incubation medium produced greater ovarian maturation than did the medium when ovarian explants were incubated with brain or thoracic ganglia alone, 5-HT presumably enhancing GSH release. In males 5-HT not only induces testicular maturation but also development of the androgenic glands. 5-HT in males, as in females, apparently triggers GSH release; but in males GSH in turn stimulates the androgenic glands which release the androgenic gland hormone, resulting in testicular maturation. In contrast, dopamine (DA) inhibits gonadal maturation in both sexes. Methionine enkephalin, like DA, slows ovarian maturation. Red pigment-concentrating hormone (RPCH), like 5-HT, stimulates ovarian maturation both in vivo and in vitro, apparently by stimulating GSH release. RPCH does not affect the ovary directly. Calcium appears to act here as a second messenger for RPCH. The implications of these findings for enhancing the culture of crustaceans is discussed.

AB  - The effects of organic and inorganic contaminants on functions regulated by hormones in crustaceans are being investigated with increasing frequency because several of these phenomena show promise of being useful biomarkers of environmental contamination. Heavy metals and organic compounds have been found in studies with crustaceans to negatively affect hormonally-regulated functions, specifically reproduction, molting, blood glucose level, and pigmentary effecters. Neurotransmitters, including 5-hydroxytryptamine and dopamine, have been identified as being involved in stimulating or inhibiting release of specific crustacean neurohormones such as the pigment-dispersing and pigment-concentrating ones involved in color changes. The effects of pollutants on at least some of these hormonally-regulated processes appear due at least in part to impacting release of a neurohormone, possibly by affecting release of the neurotransmitter that normally stimulates release of that particular neurohormone.

AB  - The melanophores of the fiddler crab, Uca pugnax, are sensitive to changes in osmotic pressure. Hypotonic solutions induce a reversible melanin dispersion. The degree of response to the melanin-dispersing principle from the sinus gland also depends to some extent upon osmotic pressure. The melanin-dispersing principle is more effective in hypotonic solutions than in hypertonic. Furthermore, this hormone is more effective in a solution of a rapidly penetrating molecule such as urea than in a slowly penetrating substance such as sucrose. A monovalent cation is essential for the melanin-dispersing principle to act most efficiently. Sodium, potassium, and lithium ions can substitute for each other in this capacity.

AB  - Many prey species are chemically defended and have conspicuous appearance to deter predators (i.e. aposematism). Such warning signals work because predators pay attention to the colour and size of signals, which they associate with unprofitability. Paradoxically, in early life stages, aposematic species are often warningly coloured, but their chemical defences are lacking because they have yet to be acquired through the diet or synthesized endogenously. This state of being conspicuous yet poorly defended must place individuals at increased risk of predation, but how they minimize this risk during development is unclear. We reared larval green and black poison frogs (Dendrobates auratus) on a relatively low or a higher food supply and tested the hypothesis that individuals with more resources should grow larger while reducing their investment in warning signals at metamorphic completion. We also assayed markers of oxidative balance (malondialdehyde, superoxide dismutase and total antioxidant capacity) to ascertain whether there were resource-allocation trade-offs that differed with diet treatments. Low-food froglets were relatively small, and their body size and signal luminance (perceived brightness) were positively correlated. In contrast, in high-food froglets body size and warning signal luminance were negatively correlated, suggesting either a resource-allocation trade-off or alternatively a facultative reduction in luminance exhibited by larger froglets. The reduction in luminance in relatively large, high-food froglets did not appear to arise because of oxidative stress: signal luminance and markers of oxidative stress were positively correlated in high-food froglets, but were negatively correlated in low-food froglets suggesting a trade-off. Our results highlight developmental plasticity in body size and coloration as affected by resource (i.e. food) supply. Such plasticity seems likely to minimize predation risk during the vulnerable period early in life when individuals are warningly coloured and must make the transition from an undefended phenotype to a mature aposematic state.

AB  - A closed-circuit television system was used to study phototaxis and behavioral responses upon sudden decreases in light intensity in light-adapted Stage I zoeae from 7 spp. of Brachyura (Panopeus herbstii, Menippe mercenaria, Uca pugilator, Callinectes sapidus, Sesarma cinereum, Pinnotheres maculatum, Libinia emarginata). All species except one showed positive phototaxis to high intensities of 500 nm light and negative phototaxis to low intensities. Upon a sudden light intensity decrease, larvae showed a shadow response, which depends upon the initial and final intensities. If the initial intensity was sufficient to induce positive phototaxis and the light was extinguished, the larvae of 6 spp. stopped swimming and passively sank (sinking response). Reducing the intensity to an absolute level that caused negative phototaxis, induced a sinking response followed by negative phototaxis. For intensity reductions that occur in the intensity range above that for negative, phototaxis, a sinking response was observed. The intensity decrease that initiated the sinking response was independent of initial stimulus intensity and duration, consistent between species and equivalent to a decrease by 0.5 OD (optical density) units. The sinking response is greatest at intensity decreases of at least 1.0-1.1 OD units. The shadow response is common in brachyuran larvae inhabiting coastal-estuarine areas.

AB  - This study tested the hypothesis that fiddler crab (Uca spp.) and blue crab [Callinectes sapidus (Rathbun)] megalopae have separate behaviors in offshore and estuarine waters that are evoked by chemical cues. Past field studies indicate that blue crab megalopae are frequently in the neuston during the day offshore, while fiddler crab megalopae are at middle depths. Both species are rarely collected in the water column during the day in estuaries but are abundant during rising tides at night. Since photoresponses contribute to the day distributions of megalopae, we hypothesize that photobehavior changes dramatically between offshore and estuarine areas and used this as an assay for the effects of water-borne chemical cues. Photoresponses were tested in a light field that mimics the underwater angular light distribution and were quantified by measuring the proportion of megalopae swimming in the upper 1/3 of a water column. For blue crab megalopae collected offshore, swimming was significantly greater in offshore than in estuarine water and was suppressed in estuarine water at high light intensities. Thus, photoresponses contribute to depth maintenance near the surface during the day which is important for onshore transport by wind-generated surface currents. When megalopae were collected in an estuary, both species had greater swimming in offshore water than in estaurine water at all light intensities and in darkness. Thus, the absence of megalopae in the water column during the day in estuaries results from light suppression of swimming. Since the water only differed in chemical composition, the changes in photoresponses were induced by chemical cues. Tests with aged estuarine water indicated the chemical cues were relatively stable or initially present at high concentrations. These results support the hypothesis and suggest that megalopae have separate behaviors in coastal/shelf areas and in estuaries, which are induced by chemical cues in offshore and estuarine waters.

AB  - SYNOPSIS. The early life cycle of brachyuran crabs has a planktonic dispersal stage consisting of a variable number of zoeal larvae followed by the molt to the megalopa stage. Megalopae undergo horizontal transport to the settlement site where they settle out of the water column and metamorphose to the first crab (juvenile) stage. This review provides an overview of recent laboratory, studies of cues that shorten or lengthen the time to metamorphosis (TTM) of the megalopa stage. Megalopae cannot delay metamorphosis indefinitely and have a temporal threshold beyond which metamorphosis occurs without habitat cues. The TTM can be shortened about 15-25% upon exposure to acceleration cues, which include chemical cues and odors from adult substrate, aquatic vegetation, biofilms, conspecifies, estuarine water, humic acids, related crab species, and potential prey. Cues shown to delay metamorphosis include ammonium, hypoxia, predator odor and extreme temperature and salinity conditions. There is no evidence that structural mimics or natural substrate affect TTM.

AB  - Megalopae (postlarvae) of the blue crab Callinectes sapidus Rathbun use flood-tide transport (FTT) for movement into and up estuaries. Since they settle around the time of slack water at the end of flood tide during FTT, it was predicted that orientation toward primary nursery areas of aquatic vegetation occurs at this time. This study tested the hypotheses that mega-lopae locate nursery areas by swimming upstream in the presence of chemical odors from potential nursery areas and avoid adverse microhabitats by swimming downstream when predator or adverse environmental odors are present. Megalopae were tested in a flume where they were exposed to the sequence of cues mediating FTT (i.e. 2 psu increase in salinity followed by an increase and a decrease in current speed and turbulence). The flume contained odor water either from the developmental area (offshore water), nursery area vegetation (seagrass, Zostera marina; salt marsh cord grass, Spartina alterniflora), predators (fiddler crab, Uca pugilator; mud crab, Panopeus herbstii; grass shrimp, Palaemonetes pugio), or chemicals associated with adverse environments (ammonium). Vertical positions of premolt and intermolt megalopae were similar in water devoid of estuarine chemical cues (offshore water) and water containing seagrass odor. Upstream swimming behavior (orientation) of intermolt megalopae was also similar in these waters. However, there was an ontogenetic behavioral change, as the proportion of premolt megalopae oriented upstream generally increased as the concentration of seagrass and salt marsh cord grass odor increased and as current speed decreased. Upstream orientation of premolt megalopae in response to seagrass odor decreased significantly (i.e. downstream swimming increased) in the presence of odor from U. pugilator, P. pugio, and ammonium, but not from P. herbstii. Thus, the hypothesis was supported. These results suggest premolt megalopae orient toward nursery areas by swimming upstream in response to odors from aquatic vegetation as current speeds decrease at the end of nocturnal flood tides. Moreover, these results also indicate that megalopae may discriminate among microhabitats and avoid adverse settlement habitat, as orientation toward nursery areas is reversed by predator odors and ammonium.

AB  - Dual stable isotope analyses (delta(13)C and delta(15)N) Of fiddler crabs from a forest-fringed, land-loci;ed lagoon in Puerto Rico indicated the differential assimilation of material from ingested sediments. Fiddler crabs preferentially selected for nitrogen-fixing benthic microalgae (cyanobacteria) over vascular plant detritus. These results question the assumption that mangrove detritus is always the principal source of energy to estuarine consumers. Previous research from this lagoon as well as from Amazonia suggests that the magnitude of land-water ecotonal coupling may be low for these particular tropical systems where benthic algal productivity is presumably high.

AB  - This review shows how well the published work on the neural basis of balance and hydrostatic pressure reception in crabs agrees with the analyses and models of path integration. Fiddler crabs allow analyses at the level of behaviour. With considerable accuracy, they continuously show the direction to home with their body orientation and use idiothetic path integration to calculate a home vector from the internal measurements of their locomotion. All crabs have a well-developed vestibular system in the statocyst with horizontal and vertical canals which is used for angular acceleration sensing and depth reception. Large identified interneurones abstract the component of angular acceleration in one of the three orthogonal planes. These have properties consistent with a key role in path integration, combining vestibular and proprioceptor information with a central excitatory drive from the hemiellipsoid bodies. They have been monitored during walking, swimming and even in freefall for a 22s period in parabolic flight.

AB  - Several times within the teleost fish order Tetraodontiformes singular jaw adducting muscles have been effectively 'duplicated' by physical subdivision to produce new muscles. This morphological system provides an opportunity to investigate how the functional complexity of muscular systems changes with evolutionary increases in the number of component muscles. In this study we asked if muscle duplication has lead to functional diversification by comparing the motor patterns of muscles that result from subdivision events. The activity patterns of five different sets of duplicated muscles were quantified with electromyographic recordings (EMG) from four individuals in each of three species during processing of three prey types. Prey varied in durability and elusiveness (live fiddler crabs, pieces of squid tentacle and live paeneid shrimps). For each cycle of prey processing, measurements were made of the relative onset time of each adductor muscle, the duration of each burst of activity, and the relative intensity of each activity burst. Two types of functional divergence of muscles were observed in analyses of variance conducted on the EMG variables. In two of the 15 variables examined, the timing of activity of the descendant set of muscles differed. In another three of the 15 variables, there were significant interactions between muscle and prey type, indicating a prey effect which differed in the descendant muscles. Overall, evidence of motor divergence was found in three of five cases of muscle duplication.

AB  - Responses of male and female Atlantic sand (Uca pugilator) and Atlantic marsh (U. pugnax) fiddler crabs to simulated bird predators were observed in South Carolina. When approached on the surface by a "predator," male and female sand fiddler crabs retreated at the same speed across the marsh surface. When reaching a burrow, male and female crabs initially descended similar distances; however, after each burrow was probed with the bill of an avian predator, females descended significantly further overall than did males. When chased, sand fiddler crabs initially retreated significantly farther into their burrows than did marsh fiddlers. However, after probing, both species had retreated similar distances overall. Sand fiddler crabs remained in their burrows three times longer than did marsh fiddler crabs. Our results suggest that crab antipredator behavior varies as a function of cost versus benefit, both within and across species.

AB  - Mangrove monkeys were known to inhabit the mangroves of S Senegal since 1906. An age-graded troop of 33 individuals was studies around the estuary of the Saloum River in 1975. The behavior of the troop indicated that they were colonizing a new area of the mangrove swamp on an island composed of mangroves. During the day, and sometimes during the night, the troop would split into smaller sub-groups or foraging parties. The home range averaged 138 ha. Behavior observed included territorial contests between adult males, foraging activity and movements. The troop spent 80% of its time within the mangrove and 13% on the mainland. Most sleeping trees were located in the mangrove. Feeding behavior was searching for fiddler crabs (Uca tangeri) in 52% of the time and eating Rhizophora flowers, fruits, shoots, etc. 22% of the time.

AB  - Aroclor 5432, a mixture of polychlorinated terphenyls (PCT), was detected in sediment and several biological compartments including: saltmarsh cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora), American oysters (Crassostrea virginica), red-jointed fiddler crabs (Uca minax), wharf crabs (Sesarma reticulatum) and mummichogs (Fundulus heteroclitus) collected from Tabbs Creek. This tidal creek is located in the southern Chesapeake Bay region. Species from several phyla were selected in order to examine PCT accumulation in physiologically and ecologically different organisms. In general, PCT concentrations in sediment and biota decreased with distance downstream from the PCT outfall. The organism with the highest mean concentration (18,300 $\mu$g/kg dry weight) was the native oyster, a benthic filter feeder. A second study examined the dose-response effects of PCT mixtures on levels of hepatic cytochrome P4501A (CYP1A) and associated EROD activity in the mummichog, relative to a polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) mixture Aroclor 1254. Fish were injected intraperitoneally with PCT formulations Aroclor 5432, Aroclor 5460, or the PCB magnitude as that caused by equivalent doses of the PCB mixture Aroclor 1254. Treatment with Aroclor 5460 did not result in significant induction. This work represents the first report of hepatic CYP1A induction caused by Aroclor 5432 in teleosts and, similar to work in mammalian systems, suggests that the effects of this mixture may be mediated through Ah receptor binding. PCT mixtures contain small amounts of PCB. Therefore, PCB may have contributed to the induction observed following Aroclor 5432 injection. The planar PCB congener 3,3',4,4'-tetrachlorobiphenyl was identified in Aroclor 5432 by GC-MS operating in negative chemical ionization mode. Environmental induction was observed in mummichogs collected from Tabbs Creek. This study revealed CYP1A induction at the two most contaminated sites along the PCT gradient. Fish at the upper creek site exhibited inhibition of EROD activity. Definitive environmental induction by PCT could not be established due to the presence of other inducing pollutants in the creek.

AB  - Vibrio parahaemolyticus, a species that includes strains known to be pathogenic in humans, and other Vibrionaceae are common, naturally occurring bacteria in coastal environments. Understanding the ecology and transport of these organisms within estuarine systems is fundamental to predicting outbreaks of pathogenic strains. Infaunal burrows serve as conduits for increased transport of tidal waters and V. parahaemolyticus cells by providing large open channels from the sediment to salt marsh tidal creeks. An extensive seasonal study was conducted at the North Inlet Estuary in Georgetown, SC, to quantify Vibrionaceae and specifically V. parahaemolyticus bacteria in tidal water, fiddler crab (Uca pugilator, Uca pugnax) burrow water, and interstitial pore water. Numbers of V. parahaemolyticus bacteria were significantly higher within burrow waters (4,875 CFU ml(-1)) than in creek water (193 CFU ml(-1)) and interstitial pore water (128 CFU ml(-1)), demonstrating that infaunal burrows are sites of V. parahaemolyticus enrichment. A strong seasonal trend of increased abundances of Vibrionaceae and V. parahaemolyticus organisms during the warmer months of May through September was observed. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) analysis of isolates presumed to be V. parahaemolyticus from creek water, pore water, and burrow water identified substantial strain-level genetic variability among V. parahaemolyticus bacteria. Analysis of carbon substrate utilization capabilities of organisms presumed to be V. parahaemolyticus also indicated physiological diversity within this clade, which helps to explain the broad distribution of these strains within the estuary. These burrows are "hot spots" of Vibrionaceae and V. parahaemolyticus cell numbers and strain diversity and represent an important microhabitat.

AB  - Infaunal burrows and the rhizosphere of Spartina alterniflora are ecologically relevant microenvironments that impact the distributions of bacteria in a salt marsh ecosystem. Infaunal burrows produced by the fiddler crabs Uca pugilator and Uca pugnax are abundant features of southeastern United States salt marshes. These water-filled burrows become significantly enriched in Vibrionaceae , and specifically Vibrio parahaemolyticus (4875 CFU mL-1 ), relative to creek waters (193 CFU mL-1 ) and interstitial porewaters (128 CFU mL-1 ). As evidenced from dye transport studies, tidal inundation flushes and transports the bacterially-enriched infaunal burrow water within the estuary over semi-diurnal tidal cycles. Marsh elevation also contributes to the frequency of tidal flushing of these burrow waters. Rhizosphere microenvironments harbor seasonally responsive and seasonally non-responsive nitrogen fixing (diazotrophic) bacterial assemblages. Vibrionaceae are represented as members of the diazotrophically-active, seasonally non-responsive assemblage, indicating that this bacterial family is also a ubiquitous and potentially important component of the rhizosphere bacterial community. Bacterial communities associated with infaunal burrow waters were found to produce significant rates of diazotrophic activity, thus introducing a novel source of organically available nitrogen into a nitrogen-limited system. Infaunal burrow waters show evidence of elevated ammonium concentrations, which could limit diazotrophic capabilities. However, when environmental diazotroph isolates and burrow water samples were evaluated for ammonium inhibition they were found to exhibit depressed diazotrophic abilities in ranges of ammonium concentration that substantially exceeded in situ levels, indicating their ability to persist and remain active in spite of elevated ammonium levels.

AB  - A steady-state numerical model has been developed for simulating vertical profiles of the concentrations of organic matter, pyritic sulfur, dissolved oxygen, and the carbon isotope composition of organic matter in marsh sediments. In the model organic matter enters the sediment via sedimentation, belowground production of roots, and chemoautotrophic fixation of interstitial CO2 associated with pyrite oxidation. Pyrite is formed by sulfate reduction and consumed by oxidation with dissolved oxygen in the interstitial water. Exchanges of organic matter, carbon isotopes, pyrite, and dissolved oxygen between the sediment and surface environment occur via fiddler crab bioturbation. Aeration of the sediments is caused by diffusion of oxygen into the interstitial water from air cavities assumed to be present in roots and in desaturated sediments pores formed in the upper part of the sediment by drainage and/or evapotranspiration. Sensitivity experiments with the model suggest that the accumulation of pyrite and organic matter in marsh sediments is governed in large part by the turnover time of roots and by the mean diameter of roots. The isotopic composition of the sediment was most sensitive to the rate of belowground production and to a lesser extent to the intensity of fiddler crab bioturbation. The model also indicate that fiddler crab burrowing can account for the observed isotope composition of creekbank sediments but not back (mid) marsh sediment. In both back and creekbank marshes, intense aeration of the sediment by roots is requried to prevent the buildup of pyrite to unrealistically high concentrations at depth.

AB  - Burrowing by fiddler crabs results in the transfer of sediment at depth to the surface, where it is washed away and replaced by sediment with a surficial 210Pb signature. It is not clear that this mode of bioturbation can be approximated by an analogy to molecular diffusion because the exchange is not between adjacent sediment parcels and does not occur in random directions. Accordingly, we propose a regeneration model to simulate the effects of fiddler crab burrowing on 210Pb profiles. The steady-state equation that describes our model is: d210Pb/dz=(-x210Pb/S)+(KB(210Pb-210Pb)exp(-z/UB))/S where .lambda. is the radioactive decay constant for 210Pb, 210Pb0 is the activity of 210Pb at the surface, S is the sedimentation rate, KB is the burrowing frequency and UB is the mean depth of a burrow. The probability of a burrow reaching or exceeding a given depth z is assumed to be distributed exponentially. Depending on the values selected for KB and UB a wide variety of profile forms can be simulated or fitted to actual data, including profiles that show an abrupt increase in the apparent sedimentation rate at depth using conventional models. We suggest that such profiles could be due to bioturbation rather than actual changes in sedimentation rate. A useful aspect of the model is that it can be used to calculate the volume of sediment turned over each year by bioturbation as a function of depth.

AB  - Soil evolution in salt marshes at North Inlet, SC (South Carolina), is driven by slowly rising sea level (3.4 mm/yr). As sea level rises the boundary between the low-lying coastal forest and high marsh moves up slope. As sandy forested Spodosols become subject to tidal inundation and salinization, forest vegetation (Pinus, Quercus, Nyssa, Lagerstroemia, and Vaccinium) is replaced successively by Cedrus, Iva, Juncus, Borrichia, Salicornia, short-form Spartina, and finally medium Spatina. These botanical changes accompany gradual changes in soil texture, chemistry and morphology. The originally sandy textured A and E horizons of the Spodosol become progressively enriched in clay and silt by tidal depostion of marine mud. These fine grained deposits do not form a distinct geogenetic layer but rather are mixed downward into the original sandy horizons by intense fiddler crab (Uca) burrowing. Thus soils in the marsh become gradually more sandy with depth. The strong color contrast between the original A and E horizons is eventually obliterated by mud enrichment and the growth of a dense Spartina root mat, leaving a medium gray A horizon that is difficult to sub-divide. In addition, the decay of organic matter in the marsh soils via sulfate reduction results in increased soil sulfur with distance into the marsh. The sandy, black spodic horizon originally formed in the forest environment occurs beneath the marsh surface at depths of less than 1 m and to the distances of several hundred meters from the forest-marsh boundary. Except perphaps for it supper 10 cm, the spodic B horizon appears to have been little affected by marsh processes. The presence of the spodic horizon in the marsh profile, and that fact that it is not buried beneath a sufficiently thick and distinct geologic deposit, poses an interesting taxonomic problem. Based on their moisture regime, sulfur content, and spodic horizons, the marsh soils are best classified as Sulfaquentic Haplaquods. However, the spodic, which is diagnosed for the classification, is clearly relict in terms of the processes that are though to be responsible for its formation.

AB  - Profiles of particulate and dissolved sulfur species have been measured in marsh sediments along three transects across the various growth zones (tall, medium and short) of Spartina alterniflora. In general, organic carbon, total sulfur, pyritic sulfur, pyritization index and dissolved sulfide increased with distance from tidal creek banks, whereas acid volatile sulfur (FeS), pH and Eh decreased with distance. These patterns probably are controlled by spatial variations in belowground production, pore water movement and fiddler crab burrowing. The creekside marsh (tall Spartina) is characterized by lower rates of belowground production (and thus lower rates of sulfate reduction and sulfide production), more vigorous drainage of pore water and more intense fidder crab burrowing as compared to the high marsh (short Spartina). Lower dissolved sulfide concentrations in the creekside marsh are promoted by lower rates of sulfate reduction and removal of dissolved sulfide by drainage at low tide. Higher pH in the creekside marsh is fostered by removal of reduced sulfur (dissolved sulfide by drainage and pyrite by fiddler crab burrowing) which then cannot be oxidized in the sediment to yield acid. The higher pH and lower dissolved sulfide of the creekside marsh, in turn, slow rate of conversion of iron oxide into pyrite in accordance with Rickerd's (1974, 1975) rate laws and thus foster a lower pyritization index. The lower pyritization index of the creekside marsh also is promoted by fidder crab burrowing which removes pyrite from the sediment and replaces it with fresh oxide from the surface or suspended source. Finally the greater availability of reactive iron oxide in the creekside marsh may shift the relative rates of FeS and FeS2 formation such that a higher steady state concentration of FeS can be maintained there as compared to the high marsh.

AB  - The fiddler crab Una rapax is a food limited detritivore that feeds on decaying cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora) in the salt marsh. Crab burrowing activity stimulates cordgrass growth, and thereby indirectly enhances their food supply. Fiddler crabs may dig more burrows than they require for their protective and physiological needs. There may be a selective advantage in digging "excess" burrows, because of the indirect benefit of enhancing food supply and decreasing the competition for food. The hypothesis that fiddler crabs "farm" cordgrass was examined by (a) comparing burrow and crab density in a salt marsh, (b) manipulating burrow density to test whether fiddler crabs dig burrows in excess of the ones available, and (c) manipulating food availability to test whether crabs adjust their burrowing activity in response to food. Results showed that (a) there were more burrows than fiddler crabs, (b) crabs dug new burrows despite the presence of unoccupied burrows, and (c) their burrowing activity varied inversely with food availability. Food availability affected the rate of burrowing by females and males equally, but had a stronger effect on burrowing by small crabs than on that of large crabs. Thus, small crabs may be more sensitive to food limitation, and may be more efficient in "farming" cordgrass.

AB  - The fiddler crab Uca rapax (Smith) feeds on microbes that colonize decaying cordgrass Spartina alterniflora Loisel. in the salt marsh. Crab-burrowing activity brings organic matter to the sediment surface. This fosters microbial growth on the organic matter and stimulates cordgrass growth. Food supply to the crabs is thereby directly and indirectly enhanced. Fiddler crabs may dig more burrows than they require for their protective and physiological needs. There may be a selective advantage in digging burrows in excess of one burrow per crab, because of the benefit of enhancing food supply and decreasing the competition for food. Fiddler crabs may dig burrows "in excess- even when empty burrows are available and they may adjust their burrowing in response to food supply. This hypothesis was examined by (a) comparing burrow and crab density in a salt marsh, then (b) manipulating burrow density and (c) food availability in the laboratory. Furthermore, females were hypothesized to be more sensitive to food availability than males, and small crabs more sensitive than large crabs. Results showed that (a) there were more burrows than fiddler crabs, (b) smaller crabs of both sexes dug new burrows despite the presence of unoccupied burrows and (c) burrowing activity of smaller crabs of both sexes varied with food availability. When food availability was lower, they excavated as much sediment and dug more burrows and burrow branches, while allocating less time to burrowing. They did so by burrowing faster and to lesser depths. Small crabs may be more sensitive to food availability and may be better capable of adjusting their burrowing to food supply.

AB  - Nitrogen pollution above a threshold level induces a eutrophication process in coastal creek ecosystems and consequently impacts on the water quality. The remedy for this scenario is the introduction of methods to enhance oligotrophication by means of constructed wetlands and buffer zones. This paper discusses new data on nitrogen flux and population changes in the primary consumers in the Bradley Creek ecosystem, adjacent to the Duck Haven Golf Course in southeastern North Carolina. In 1998-99, over different seasons, density distribution of the field populations of the fiddler crab Uca minax, was monitored as an indicator of environmental health. A control site at Whiskey Creek, adjacent to the University Center for Marine Sciences, was monitored in the same period since this site is not influenced by any golf course nutrient flux. The results pointed out that threshold level for optimum population density in Spartina grandiflora salt marsh is 0.1 mg/L of nitrates. A dense crab population, adjacent to the golf course with a buffer zone, was indicative of restoration of the estuarine ecosystem. A model, involving the use of constructed wetlands for oligotrophication, is being prepared on the basis of studies conducted by the University of South Alabama for a stormwater wetland constructed adjacent to the university's golf course.

AB  - The present study documents for the first time shell use by juvenile fiddler crabs in the salt marsh. Twenty visits were made to six salt marsh sites at Tybee Island, Georgia between 2007 and 2009. One hundred empty Littorina irrorata shells were collected at each site on each field trip. Juvenile carapace width was measured, crabs sexed, and species identification completed using RFLP analysis. Shell use of up to 79% was observed. Two species of fiddler crabs were found in empty shells, Uca pugnax and U. pugilator. U. pugnax was the dominant species at all sites representing 62-84% of the juvenile fiddler crab population. Juvenile sex ratios were female-biased (1.7:1) at all six sites. Juvenile size did not vary significantly between species but males of both species were significantly larger than females. Size frequency distribution of carapace width revealed that shell use varied with size and sex. In the 3 to 4 mm size class, juvenile females outnumbered juvenile males in empty L. irrorata shells while in the 5 to 6 mm size class and greater, juvenile males outnumbered juvenile females in shells. Significantly more juvenile fiddler crabs were found in empty shells during flood than ebb tide at 3 of the sites. This discovery illuminates the resourcefulness of juvenile fiddler crabs and provides another mechanism that might enhance survival. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Sexual selection occurs when females preferentially produce offspring with males possessing exaggerated traits. However, sexually-selected traits may simultaneously reduce male fitness by hindering other characteristics, such as locomotor performance. The male fiddler crab (Uca pugilator) is a prime example of an animal with an enhanced sexually-selected trait (i.e. one enlarged claw used to attract females) that could impede locomotion. We hypothesized that the possession of a major claw by males would reduce their locomotor performance and, more specifically, that the negative impact would be greatest for animals moving on steeper inclines and on more compliant substrates. We measured the mean and maximum speeds, stride lengths, and stride frequencies of male and female fiddler crabs moving on two substrates (dry and wet sand) and at three different inclines (0°, 15°, 30°). Performance was measured before and after the major claw was removed from the males. Crabs of both sexes exhibited significant decreases in velocity when moving on the more compliant substrate (dry sand) and on steeper inclines. The removal of the claw did not significantly increase the speeds of males moving horizontally on either substrate. However, claw removal did significantly increase speeds on both 15° and 30° inclines (by 26% and 32% respectively). These results suggest that the costs of carrying an exaggerated claw are incline dependent, or, more generally, that habitat characteristics may play a crucial role in the evolution of sexually-selected traits.

AB  - Since the 1970s, the ability of some invertebrate species to recognize individual conspecifics has attracted increased scientific interest. However, there is still confusion in the literature, possibly due to the lack of unambiguous criteria for classifying social recognition in its different forms. Here, we synthesize the results of studies on invertebrates and provide a framework with the purpose of identifying research needs and directions for future investigations. Following in part Sherman et al.'s (Behavioural ecology: an evolutionary approach. Blackwell Science, Oxford, pp 69-96, 1997) definition of 'recognition systems' and Tibbetts and Dale's (Trends Ecol Evol 22:529-537, 2007) classification of 'individual recognition,' we first discuss different case studies that exemplify the categories of 'familiar recognition' and 'class-level recognition.' Then, through the analysis of the invertebrate literature, we illustrate eight key properties that characterize 'true individual recognition' systems. We are confident that the proposed framework will provide opportunities for exciting discoveries of the cognitive abilities in invertebrates.

AB  - Tidal migrations of fishes are influenced by several coincident factors (abiotic and biotic). The interactive effect of these multiple factors has never been analyzed statistically in a model approach. We used proportional hazards analysis to analyze the interactive effect of space (4 creeks) and time (diurnal neap tide cycles in 2 seasons) on patterns in the intertidal migration of 3 size classes of the banded puffer fish Colomesus psittacus (Tetraodontidae) from mangrove creeks and link this to ontogenetic and temporal changes in feeding. The intertidal migration strategy and patterns of vertical resource exploitation changed ontogenetically, thereby reducing intraspecific competition. Juvenile fish entered creeks earlier and left later, which resulted in longer feeding times and fuller intestines than adults. Juveniles fed mainly on barnacles and fiddler crabs from the mid-intertidal, while adults were specialized predators of the mangrove crab Ucides cordatus from the high intertidal. The shape of the migration curves (the proportions of fish leaving a creek at a given ebb tide water level) indicated that the tidal migration took place in close response to creek-specific drainage characteristics and suggests that the fish interact successfully with variable and dynamic creek features in a macrotidal mangrove environment. When ebb tide cycles were completed during daylight hours, the tidal migration was well-structured. When ebb tide overlapped with sunset, juveniles left earlier, and the tidal migration was compressed. We provide a time budget scenario of habitat use by diurnal C. psittacus during a 15 d spring-neap tide cycle according to the changes in interactions of flood and ebb tide with sunset and sunrise.

AB  - Carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios ((13)C and (15)N) and trophic level (TL) estimates based on stomach content analysis and published data were used to assess the contribution of autotrophic sources to 55 consumers in an intertidal mangrove creek of the Curuca estuary, northern Brazil. Primary producers showed delta(13)C signatures ranging between -29.2 and -19.5 parts per thousand, and delta(15)N from 3.0 to 6.3 parts per thousand, The wide range of the isotopic composition of carbon of consumers (-28.6 to -17.1 parts per thousand) indicated that different autotrophic sources are important in the intertidal mangrove food webs. Food web segregation structures the ecosystem into three relatively distinct food webs: (i) mangrove food web, where vascular plants contribute directly or indirectly via POM to the most (13)C-depleted consumers (e.g. Ucides cordatus and zooplanktivorous food chains); (ii) algal food web, where benthic algae are eaten directly by consumers (e.g. Uca maracoani, mullets, polychaetes, several fishes); (iii) mixed food web where the consumers use the carbon from different primary sources (mainly benthivorous fishes). An IsoError mixing model was used to determine the contributions of primary sources to consumers, based on delta(13)C values. Model outputs were very sensitive to the magnitude of trophic isotope fractionation and to the variability in (13)C data. Nevertheless, the simplification of the system by a priori aggregation of primary producers allowed interpretable results for several taxa, revealing the segregation into different food webs.

AB  - As part of a study to investigate the effect of chronic eutrophication on salt marshes, a sludge fertilizer has been applied to experimental plots in Great Sippewissett Marsh, Ma. since 1974. The fertilizer contains substantial amounts of heavy metals. Sediments from fertilized plots contain elevated levels of Cu, Cd, Zn, Fe, Mn, Cr, and Pb. The above and below ground portions of the dominate grass, Spartina alterniflora, contain significantly higher levels of Cd, Cr, Cu, and Zn when compared to grasses from control plots. The mussel, Modiolus demissus, from fertilized plots contain elevated levels of Cu, Cd, and Cr. The fiddler crab, Uca pugnax contains more Cu and Cd than control animals. Low marsh sediments fertilized for eight years retained 15% Cd, 24% Fe, 27% Mn, 28% Zn, 45% Cr, 49% Cu, and 60% of the Pb in the fertilizer. Plots which had only received fertilizer for one year retained a higher percentage of the metals which had been added. The pore waters of sediments from fertilized plots contained higher levels of ammonia, phosphorus, Cu, Fe, Zn, Mn, and Cd than pore waters from control areas (Pb and Cr were not measured). Levels of sulfides in the fertilized sediments were nearly an order of magnitude lower than in control sediments. In control sediment the pore water is supersaturated for pyrite (FeS(,2)), CuS, and ZnS and undersaturated for FeS most of the year. Cd is non-detectable. The pore waters of the fertilized plots are undersaturated for FeS, pyrite, ZnS, and CdS for most of the year. Gel filtration of pore water showed that less than 10% of the Mn and Cd were found associated with high MW organics. The amount of iron associated with high MW fractions ranged from 53% to 34% and decreased with decreasing UV absorbance in the pore water sample. Organically bound copper ranged from 90% to 25% of the total. Fertilization has also altered the microbial community. Microbes from the fertilized plots have a lower oxygen uptake rate when grown on sterile marsh peat than microbes from control plots. When grown in the presence of metals, the oxygen uptake of microbes is decreased but microbes from fertilized plots are significantly less depressed than microbes from control plots.

AB  - Ecologists have long been interested in identifying and testing factors that drive top-down or bottom-up regulation of communities. Most studies have focused on factors that directly exert top-down (e.g., grazing) or bottom-up (e.g., nutrient availability) control on primary production. For example, recent studies in salt marshes have demonstrated that fronts of Littoraria irrorata periwinkles can overgraze Spartina alterniflora and convert marsh to mudflat. The importance of indirect, bottom-up effects, particularly facilitation, in enhancing primary production has also recently been explored. Previous field studies separately revealed that fiddler crabs, which burrow to depths of more than 30 cm, can oxygenate marsh sediments and redistribute nutrients, thereby relieving the stress of anoxia and enhancing S. alterniflora growth. However, to our knowledge, no studies to date have explored how non-trophic facilitators can mediate top-down effects (i.e., grazing) on primary-producer biomass. We conducted a field study testing whether fiddler crabs can facilitate S. alterniflora growth sufficiently to mitigate overgrazing by periwinkles and thus sustain S. alterniflora marsh. As inferred from contrasts to experimental plots lacking periwinkles and fiddler crabs, periwinkles alone exerted top-down control of total aboveground biomass and net growth of S. alterniflora. When fiddler crabs were included, they counteracted the effects of periwinkles on net S. alterniflora growth. Sediment oxygen levels were greater and S. alterniflora belowground biomass was lower where fiddler crabs were present, implying that fiddler crab burrowing enhanced S. alterniflora growth. Consequently, in the stressful interior S. alterniflora marsh, where subsurface soil anoxia is widespread, fiddler crab facilitation can mitigate top-down control by periwinkles and can limit and possibly prevent loss of biogenically structured marsh habitat and its ecosystem services.

AB  - Assessing submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) in mangroves can be challenging due to the complex, heterogeneous nature of sediments and temporally dynamic water flows. Here, we use natural tracers (i.e., radon and radium isotopes) to quantify groundwater-surface water exchange in a mangrove tidal creek at the ecosystem scale, and to assess whether SGD was a source of dissolved inorganic and organic nutrients to the nearby estuary. Hourly sampling for over 27 h in the winter and 30 h in the summer revealed clear tidal trends for Rn-222, Ra-224, Ra-223, Ra-226, dissolved oxygen, ammonium, and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) in a mangrove tidal creek with no upstream freshwater inputs (Kangaroo Island, Southern Moreton Bay, Australia). Nitrate, phosphate and dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP) did not show a clear tidal trend. A mass balance revealed that 5-12% of the tidal prism volume infiltrated the sediments and drained back to the creek at low tide. Groundwater exchange accounted for nearly all the ammonium and about 30% of the DON exported by the creek. Crab burrows were a major factor influencing groundwater exchange in this tidal creek. A detectable Ra-226 (half-life of 1600 years) enrichment in the creek at low tide could only be explained by the construction of new crab burrows during each tidal cycle exposing old sediments. Overall, the concentration of groundwater tracers and nutrients was higher in the summer most likely due to increased crab activity and organic matter degradation in the warmer months. Respiration of belowground organic matter apparently released nitrogen to groundwater seeping out from the creek bank at low tide and increased N:P ratios of surface water draining from mangroves. Therefore, we hypothesize that outwelling from mangroves with high SGD may influence the composition of downstream biological communities by altering estuarine N or P limitation conditions.

AB  - Decapod crustacean megalopae were sampled weekly (spring/neap tides) during late-spring/summer of 1998 by using two planktonic nets located close to the surface and the bottom, at a fixed station in the mouth of the Rio San Pedro inlet (SW Spain). Sampling was carried out during 25 h cycles to ascertain the flux of megalopae in relation to the main environmental (diel, tidal, tidal amplitude) cycles. The hypothesis that megalopae of some species may be using tidal- stream transport as a mechanism of reinvading the inlet was tested and the relationship between megalopal behaviour and life history strategy was analysed. In general, the flux of megalopae was higher during spring tides, but such differences were only statistically significant for Pisidia longicornis and Liocarcinus sp.2 due to the considerable interdate variation. With the exception of Macropodia sp., megalopae were more abundant close to the bottom. The diel/tidal flux of most abundant species suggested two different patterns of behaviour: megalopae of Liocarcinus spp., Panopeus africanus, Uca tangeri and Brachynotus sextientatus seemed to be re-invading the inlet (specially at nocturnal floods), while megalopae of Ilia nucleus, Nepinnotheres pinnotheres and Macropodia sp. may have been just looking for a suitable place for settlement. The first group corresponded to the species whose zoeal development occurs in open sea, and the second one to species that complete their life cycle within the studied system, suggesting a relationship between the duration of the larval phase and the life cycle strategy of the species.

AB  - Plankton studies over the long southern coast of Iberian Peninsula are very scarce and restricted to a few specific taxonomic groups. In order to know the dynamic of decapod larvae coastal assemblages from south-western of Iberian Peninsula, three zones were studied: Guadalquivir Estuary, Cadiz Bay and Algeciras Bay. The three zones differ by their freshwater inflow and turbidity (highest in Guadalquivir Estuary), primary production (highest in Cadiz Bay) and nutrient concentrations (lowest in Algeciras Bay). The material is based upon plankton samples (250 pm mesh) collected monthly at eight stations distributed between these zones, during 1 year. Maximum values of abundance and diversity were found in Cadiz Bay, while the lowest were recorded in Algeciras Bay. Brachyura was the main abundant taxonomic group in larval decapod assemblages, while Dendrobranchiata, Palinura, Stenopodidea, and Astacidea were scarcely represented or absent. From the 69 taxa identified. 11 were considered rare and 12 taxa constituted 87% of the total larvae collected. Liocarcinus spp. was the most representative taxon, being present in all stations and showing high abundance and dominance values. The annual distribution was specifically studied for Liocarcinus spp.. Carcinus maenas, Xantho spp., Ilia nucleus, Uca tangeri, Brachynotus spp., Hippolyte spp., Philocheros spp., Pisidia longicornis, Diogenes pugilator, Pilumnus spp. and Upogebia sp. Attending to the temporal distribution of dominant taxa, three abundance patterns are shown for decapod larvae at study zones: (i) species present in non-warm months; (ii) species present in warm months; (iii) species present through all year.

AB  - 1. An ecological and behavioural study was made of the five Uca species of Inhaca Island.
2. In addition to the claw-waving shown by males as a threat-display or as part of courtship behaviour, various modifications of the phenomenon of claw-waving were also noticed. The most widespread of these modifications was a type of synchronous claw-waving, shown only by males of U. annulipes.
3. Synchronous claw-waving is a form of concerted waving by small groups of individuals.
4. The movements involved in synchronous claw-waving are described in detail.
5. Synchronous claw-waving showed both a seasonal and a diurnal peak, and thus has a definite connection with temperature.
6. This highly specialised form of claw-waving is probably due to the abundant energy of the U. annulipes individuals, which spend the most time of all the species above-ground, feeding.

AB  - The fiddler crab, Uca tetragonon (Herbst) mates both on the surface near female-defended burrows and underground in male-defended burrows. In underground mating, which requires relatively high male investment, males attract both non-ovigerous and ovigerous females into their burrows by claw waving. Males aggressively expel some females soon after they enter their burrows and others after pair formation, but before females spawn. Finally males guard some females in their burrows until they spawn, which presumably ensures paternity. Males do not select mates of a particular body size, but they do differentially accept females with late-stage eggs, those about to release larvae and spawn another clutch. Except at the beginning of the reproductive season, few ripe non-ovigerous females are available because females spawn successively and only in moderate synchrony. By differentially accepting late stage ovigerous females, males may increase their fertilization rates because they minimize the time they spend guarding each of their mates to ensure their paternity. A male-biased operational sex ratio and a high last male advantage in sperm competition are two conditions that may have favored male choice based on female guarding time in this species.

AB  - In Puerto Rico, the number of nonnative Green Iguana, Iguana iguana, has increased and the species has proliferated throughout the island. Reports on diet in the iguana's native range indicate exclusive herbivory, but observations in their nonnative range occasionally include animal materials. The aim of our study was to determine the diet and trophic level of I. iguana in Puerto Rico using gut content and stable isotopic analysis of muscle tissue (tongue and leg). We found significant differences in the isotopic signature between leg and tongue tissue, which may be related to differing strategies for allocating nutrients during muscle formation. The isotopic analysis of delta N-15 and delta C-13 showed little enrichment of both muscle tissues from that of their diet, demonstrating that I. iguana is primarily an herbivore. However, gut contents provided evidence for a first report of I. iguana eating crabs (Uca spp.). The gut contents consisted primarily of black mangrove leaves (Avicennia germinans), suggesting a higher impact of herbivory on this species of mangrove. Another plant species of interest found in the gut was Brazilian pepper, Schinus terebinthifolius. We suspect that I. iguana may be a disperser of this aggressive invasive plant in Puerto Rico. Our study indicates that I. iguana impacts the native flora and fauna in Puerto Rico, and that the ecological role of this species in introduced ranges warrants further investigation.

AB  - Three widely used methods of estimating fluctuating asymmetry may yield serious overestimates if directional asymmetry is present. When two sides of a bilateral trait grow at different rates, then the asymmetry variance (Var[l-r]) increases with size, even when developmental noise is nil. But the residual variance around a population's mean developmental trajectory is invariant with respect to size. Thus, it can be used as a measure of developmental instability. We introduce a measure of developmental instability, the residual variance (s(delta)(2)), obtainable from either a major axis regression: which is equivalent to a principal component analysis on l and r, or a general structural model. This residual variance can be estimated from directionally asymmetric or even antisymmetric traits. We present examples of developmental instability estimated from directionally asymmetric mandibles (house mouse) and leaves (soybean), and antisymmetric flaws (fiddler crab).

AB  - Some studies of crabs collected from polluted environments showed increased resistance of crabs to exposure to low levels of toxicants. However, other studies have found that additional stress on these crabs resulted in collapse. This study investigated the effects of sublethal concentrations of methylmercury and naphthalene on the burrowing behavior, locomotor activity and molting and limb regenenation of fiddler crabs Uca pugnax collected from a polluted (Piles Creek = PC) and from a relatively unpolluted (Sheepshead Creek = SC) salt-marsh. The laboratory experiments were supplemented by field studies, comparing sizes of crabs from the two locations. Burrowing behavior was examined in the laboratory in individual rectangular plastic trays. Locomotor activity was tested using Omnitech Electronic's Digiscan Animal Activity Monitor. In the molting and regeneration experiments, multiple autotomy of six limbs was induced on each crab. In the field, I measured: limb length, carapace width, and size of gravid females. I documented/observed reduced burrowing activity, increased locomotor activity, reduced R-value (which is limb bud length x 100/carapace width) and reduced percentage of molting crabs in SC and PC crabs which were exposed in the laboratory to either 0.1mg/l or to 0.3mg/l of methylmercury and in SC crabs exposed to 0.5mg/l of naphthalene. PC crabs which were exposed to 0.5mg/l of naphthalene also exhibited reduced R-value and reduced percentage of molting crabs. In the field, size measurements of male crabs revealed no significant difference between SC and PC. On the other hand, carapace width of PC females was significantly larger than carapace width of SC females. This study demonstrates that the conclusions of a study can differ depending on: which aspect of the crab's behavior or physiology is tested, the type and concentration of the toxicant, and the crab's environment. Burrowing, locomotor activity, molting and regeneration are vital to the well being of fiddler crabs, and may be important to the overall marsh ecology. A change in these parameters in crabs exposed to toxicants is a response that may have deleterious effects on the species and on the ecosystem.

AB  - The influence of macrofauna and macrophytes on sediment biogeochemistry was quantified in a Spartina alterniflora (Loisel) saltmarsh, with emphasis on sulfur and iron cycling. Vertical profiles of sediment geochemistry and rates of microbial metabolism at 3 sites with different abundances of fiddler crab Uca pugnax burrows, vegetation coverage and hydrology were supplemented with high-resolution radial profiles around burrow walls and S. alterniflora roots. Carbon oxidation was measured as sulfate reduction using the S-35 technique, as total anaerobic CO2 production, and as Fe(III) reduction by monitoring Fe(II) evolution. Depth-integrated (0 to 10 cm) sulfate reduction was 25% lower, while total Fe and Fe(III) concentrations were 1.5 and 6 times higher, respectively, in bioturbated than in nonbioturbated sediment. Low sulfate-reduction rates adjacent to burrow walls (3% of those in bulk sediment) were counteracted by very high Fe(III) reduction rates. Thus, Fe(III) reduction accounted for 54 to 86% of the total carbon oxidation within 4 cm distance of burrows, decreasing in importance with distance from the burrow wall. Overall, S. alterniflora roots showed a greater impact on sediment biogeochemistry than crab burrows. Sulfate reduction was almost absent in the rhizosphere, whereas Fe(III) reduction rates (6.2 mumol Fe cm(-3) d(-1)) were among the highest reported for marine sediments, accounting for >99% of carbon oxidation. Our results confirm the universal relationship between the contribution of Fe(III) respiration to total carbon oxidation and solid Fe(III) concentrations that has been suggested based on studies of subtidal marine sediments. The importance of Fe(Ill) respiration was strongly dependent on Fe(III) concentrations below levels of 30 mumol cm(-3), whereas above this level almost all anaerobic respiration was mediated by Fe(III) reduction in saltmarsh sediments.

AB  - In Florida, P. thomae (Fabricius) nested in firm sand along the edge of a salt marsh. Six females were observed to restructure burrows of the fiddler crab, Uca rapax (Smith). Behavior of 1 female, observed during a complete nest cycle, differed from previous records for Nearctic species by construction of a nest prior to prey-hunting, and by carriage of prey in flight. Explanations for such different behavior include adaptation to a littoral habitat, and the possibility that this represents a cryptic species which is confused with P. thomae.

AB  - Two different types of brachyurins, termed I and II, have been described in the literature. Within type I there are two subtypes, Ia and Ib. The prototype for the type I brachyurins is Fiddler crab collagenase I. Its coldadapted analogue from Antarctic krill, termed euphaulysin, shares many of its characteristics. Both enzymes are distinguished by their broad substrate specificity as well as the ability to cleave collagen. The precursor form of euphaulysin has been expressed in Pichia pastoris and processed to its fully active form using cod trypsin. A molecular model of euphaulysin, based on the known crystal structure of crab collagenase I, indicates that the core structure of these enzymes is almost identical. As a coldadapted enzyme, euphaulysin has a higher catalytic efficiency than crab collagenase I. It is also more sensitive to thermal inactivation and autolysis. Furthermore, euphaulysin has an increased length of several surface loops compared to crab collagenase I. Extended surface loops have been suggested to play a role in the cold activity of some bacterial enzymes. Sensitivity to autolysis is an important factor which contributes to the thermal instability of euphaulysin. Substitution of a highly exposed residue in the autolysis loop of euphaulysin resulted in an increased stability of the enzyme towards thermal inactivation without altering its catalytic efficiency.

AB  - Theories of large-scale (kilometres) movement of carbon within and from estuaries are of ten not supported by empirical data, and this provided the basis for a smaller-scale (i.e. <100 m) analysis of carbon movement and assimilation between adjacent habitats. We tested 3 models that potentially explained the movement and assimilation of carbon by resident animals in estuarine habitats at different spatial scales: coarse (>30 m), intermediate (2 to 30 m) and fine (<2 m). The carbon stable isotope signatures of 2 crab and 2 gastropod species were measured at different positions in saltmarsh and mangrove habitats (centre, intermediate and edge in the saltmarsh, intermediate and centre positions in adjacent mangroves) at 5 sites. The delta(13)C signatures of crabs collected from the saltmarsh (-15.6 +/- 0.2parts per thousand) were significantly more enriched than those of crabs from the mangrove habitat (-22.1 +/- 0.3parts per thousand), but did not differ between positions within each habitat. The delta(13)C signatures of crabs in the saltmarsh were similar to those of the dominant macrophyte, the salt couch grass Sporobolus virginicus (-14.9 +/- 0.1parts per thousand). The delta(13)C signatures of crabs in the mangrove habitat were enriched relative to those of the mangroves (-27.6 +/- 0.2parts per thousand), but were similar to those of the microphytobenthos in that habitat (-24.6 +/- 0.7parts per thousand). The crabs thus fitted the fine-scale model of assimilation of carbon produced in their immediate vicinity, although the signatures for crabs in the mangrove habitat were also consistent with a food source comprising a mixture of mangroves and a more enriched source, possibly the salt couch grass S. virginicus. Gastropods were found only in the saltmarsh habitat. Their delta(13)C signatures did not differ among central and intermediate positions (-15.3 +/- 0.2parts per thousand) but were lower at edge positions (-17.0 +/- 0.1parts per thousand). The delta(13)C signatures of gastropods indicated assimilation of carbon from sources 2 to 15 m away, at the lower end of the intermediate scale. The extent of carbon movement and assimilation varies among estuaries, and our results show that in some situations it occurs at scales much smaller than previously realised.

AB  - Digestive associations between marine invertebrates and resident (attached) microbial communities may play a critical role in host physiology and involve previously unidentified microbial species. The overarching goal of this thesis was to characterize the ecology and genetic diversity of resident gut microbes to advance our understanding of their interactions with their host, the marsh fiddler crab, Uca pugnax . Furthermore, we assessed whether microbes benefit the host by contributing extracellular enzymes along the digestive tract. This is the first report of the eccrinid protists, Enteromyces callianassae and Enterobryus sp., inhabiting U. pugnax . The greatest abundances of both bacteria and protists were documented in the host stomach and hindgut. For these sections, we have described morphologies, measured abundances and characterized the genetic diversity (bacteria) of resident microbes. Presence and abundance of the Eccrinales protists depends on host molt stage as all eccrinid biomass is shed with the host's molt. In intermolt crabs, both bacterial and protozoan symbionts appear to be consistent features of the stomach and hindgut. Furthermore, bacterial diversity patterns seem to be comparable among individuals and over time, as assessed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). Community composition, however, does differ between stomach and hindgut populations, as resolved by DGGE and clone libraries of the 16S rRNA gene. Many recovered clones were most closely related to other symbiotic or gut-associated bacteria. Few identified clones, however, shared more than 95% 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity with their nearest known relatives, indicating that this environment may support novel bacterial phylotypes. An exception was the U. pugnax hindgut phylotype most closely related to a phylotype identified from hindguts of the detritivorous shrimp Neotrypaea californiensis . This finding suggests that detritivorous crustacean hindguts may provide an ecological niche for specific bacterial phylotypes. Functionally, resident bacteria, particularly in the hindgut, may contribute to total enzyme activity in the gut of their host.

Zoological Studies 51(5): 598-605. Building of soil structures is observed in a variety of semi-terrestrial crustaceans. In fiddler crabs (Genus Uca), this behavior occurs in several species, some of which build structures that are largely ornamental and others construct barriers that are apparently for defense. Although there is a relative abundance of studies on this type of behavior in Uca, the relationship between the social context and the occurrence of these structures remains poorly studied. Thus, this study attempted to analyze in detail the construction, occurrence, and function of mud chimneys built by the fiddler crab Uca thayeri; these sedimentary structures are possibly associated with burrow defense. Field investigations and laboratory experiments were conducted. Both sexes were often found in burrows with chimneys; however, laboratory experiments showed that only females actively built and maintained chimneys, with some difference in the morphology of these structures between sexes. The social context had little influence on the construction of chimneys, which showed that the stimulus for constructing chimneys could be endogenous. Our results suggest that burrows with chimney of U. thayeri may have functions other than defense, and may act in regulating the internal conditions of the burrow, as observed in other crustaceans with such building behavior. http://zoolstud.sinica.edu.tw/Journals/51.5/598.pdf

AB  - Salt marshes along the South Eastern US coast are largely dominated by the macrophytes Spartina alterniflora (Loisel) and Juncus roemerianus (Scheele) which form vast stands with robust, interconnecting root systems and contribute to sediment accretion, functioning to shape intertidal zones. Large stands of these grasses are punctuated by mud flats and infaunal burrows of the fiddler crabs Uca pugnax (Bosc) and Uca pugilator (Smith); the feeding and burrowing actions of which, serve to ventilate and redistribute the marsh sediment. Bacteria belonging to the genus Vibrio are flagellated gram negative rods or curved rods common throughout marine systems. Vibrios inhabit a range of niches within the water column, attached to sediment particles and in symbiotic associations with marine animals and plants. Most commonly though, vibrios are known for their pathogenic nature and are the causative agents of many diseases of humans and other animals. In general, vibrios are understudied in natural systems free of anthropogenic influence. This investigation examined the physiological activities, biogeography and pathogenic potential of Vibrionaceae from the pristine intertidal North Inlet, SC saltmarsh. The ability of several Vibrio species isolated from S. alterniflora and J. roemerianus rhizoplanes; to synthesize the phytohormone indole-3 acetic acid via the indole-3-acetamide pathway was elucidated and quantified. An extensive study of the density and biogeography of Vibrionaceae in sediment, burrow and water microniches was conducted and a collection of 186 presumptive Vibrio parahaemolyticus strains was isolated. Sediment microenvironments were found overall to harbor the highest density (480,000 CFUs mL-1 in the S. alterniflora growth zone) of presumptive V. parahaemolyticus and Vibrionaceae in general. A randomly selected sub-group of these strains was further characterized physiologically and phylogenetically. Presumptive V. parahaemolyticus strains were screened for the species specific marker thermolabile hemolysin (tlh ) and the human virulence marker genes thermostable direct hemolysin (tdh ) and thermostable direct hemolysin-related hemolysin (trh ). Newly designed primers were employed for PCR reactions targeting tdh and trh which were found to be substantially more effective than older commonly employed primers. The genes encoding TDH and TRH were present in 41% and 7.3% of the Vibrionaceae strains examined shifting the paradigm of conventional wisdom on this subject.

AB  - The complex nature of, and importance of detritus consumption in, estuarine food webs make analysis of specific pathways of C in estuaries very difficult. The use of the natural abundances of the stable C isotopes in estuarine flora and fauna was evaluated as a qualitative indicator of food sources in a Georgia, USA salt marsh estuary. The salt marsh ecosystem is particularly amenable to this technique because of the wide span of distinctive 13C/12C ratios of the dominant plants .delta.13C of -12 to -26.permill.. Laboratory experiments showed negligible further fractionation of the characteristic .delta.13C of marsh plants during microbial degradation of dead plant material and during assimilation of ingested detritus by estuarine invertebrates. Invertebrates having a variety of feeding habits were collected in monospecific and mixed species stands of marsh plants. Marsh snails and insects had .delta.13C values close to those of the associated vascular plants. Deposit-feeding crabs had isotope ratios biased away from the marsh plant .delta.13C values, likely a result of feeding on benthic diatoms and out-of-stand foraging. Mud snails and filter-feeding bivalves showed 13C/12C ratios similar to those of benthic and pelagic algae. The .delta.13C values of marsh fiddler crabs varied from -12 to -24.permill. in various habitats having predominately C4 or C3 food source plants. Individuals collected from populations of 3 crab spp. [Eurytium sp., Sesarma reticulatum and Uca sugnax] in a Spartina alterniflora marsh had 13C/12C ratios with an SD of only about 1.permill. from the mean .delta.13C. Stable C isotope ratio analysis appears to be a powerful tool in the evaluation of C pathways in estuarine food webs.

AB  - A game theoretical analysis is presented of animal contest situations which are asymmetric in more than 1 aspect: 2 opponents are imagined which differ in ownership status as well as in relative fighting ability. The following question is analyzed: which aspect may or must be used for conventional settlement in a population playing an evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS)? The contestants are fully informed about the asymmetric features. The assessment of relative fighting ability is unambiguous and without cost. This assumption of perfect information allows for a decomposition of the evolutionary game into subgames. An easy procedure for calculating the ESS is presented and simple models are analyzed. Payoff-irrelevant aspects are used for conventional settlement of a conflict even if payoff-relevant asymmetric aspects also exist. One of the aspects may be of such strong relevance that, no matter which ESS is played, animals must base their decisions on that dominant aspect. It may also occur that 2 different asymmetric features are each of strong payoff relevance for either of the opponents, such that they have no escalation-suppressing effect. The scenario of a conflict between an owner of a resource and an intruder is used to derive conclusions.

AB  - Isolation due to geographical barriers should promote genetic and morphological divergence among populations. Marine currents flowing in opposing directions along landmasses can constitute barriers that isolate populations dependent upon aquatic dispersal. The distribution of fiddler crabs (genus Uca) is regulated primarily by the oceanic transport of their planktonic larvae and by available adult habitat. Along the Brazilian coast of eastern South America, the flow of 2 major oceanic currents separates northern from southern Uca populations, which may promote intraspecific divergence in ‘trans-Brazilian’ species. Populations of 10 Uca species were sampled at 64 locations north and south of the Ponta do Calcanhar, Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil. Carapace shape was assessed using geometric morphometrics to analyze 12 surface landmarks in 1319 female crabs. Carapace shape differs significantly in each species. In morphospace, the carapace forms of the 10 species appear to separate into traditional subgeneric clusters. Within the 8 species exhibiting trans-Brazilian distributions, northern and southern populations show distinct carapace differences. Depending on species, either the hepatic or the branchial region is larger in northern populations. Since significant genetic variability among such populations has not been confirmed, divergence in carapace shape suggests significant ecological modulation of phenotype within each species. Apparently, environmental differences between northern and southern localities exert a greater impact on carapace morphology than impeded gene flow. The drivers under - pinning diversification of carapace shape remain unknown, however.

AB  - In fiddler crabs, the two most common mating tactics are burrow mating, in which males attract females into the male burrow by claw waving, and surface mating, in which males mate with a female on the surface near her burrow. Most fiddler crab species perform one or both of these tactics. There is also the much less common tactic of “directing,” in which a male, with his claw outstretched, attempts to back a female into a burrow for mating. We studied the fiddler crab Uca princeps in the upper Gulf of California; this population practices the directing tactic exclusively. If the male is successful in maneuvering the female into a burrow, he then is often challenged by neighboring males and must fight to defend the burrow and the female. Directing may be indicative of sexual conflict in this species; or it may point to “screening” by the female, in which female behavior serves as a filter for the highest quality mates. This study was undertaken to differentiate between these two alternatives by looking for signs that successful males are those that are able to best overcome female resistance (symptomatic of sexual conflict), or evidence that females mate with the highest quality males (suggesting screening behavior). We found that successful males did not have higher values of two quality indicator traits than unsuccessful males; however, they were relatively larger and heavier than the females they mated. The directing success of larger males and the unimportance of male quality in this mating system are more consistent with sexual conflict than screening. However, evidence of a cost to females inflicted by this male behavior is needed to definitively demonstrate sexual conflict.

AB  - Leu-enkephalin containing secretory granules were demonstrated in axon terminals of immunogold-labeled electron-microscopic sections of the sinus gland of three brachyuran crustaceans. These granules have a diameter of 120 +/- 15 nm and differ in electron density from those located in adjacent terminals containing hyperglycemic or molt-inhibiting hormone. These neurohormones do not show co-localization with leu-enkephalin. The cross-reactivity of leu-enkephalin antiserum with met-enkephalin is less than 1 %. The sinus glands of the three species examined show no immunoreactivity for FMRF-amide. A modulatory activity of endogenous enkephalin by paracrine mechanisms is suggested.

AB  - Recently, Phragmites australis (common reed) in North American wetlands has changed from a species with limited distribution to an invasive species producing dense monospecific stands. This expansion has forced out other wetland vegetation, potentially changing the functions of these ecosystems. Little research has focused on whether P. australis stands serve as valuable wetland habitat and foraging areas for terrestrial animals and resident marsh nekton. This study addressed the effect of different hydrologic and geomorphic conditions among P. australis stands on abundance of resident nekton in Piermont Marsh, located on the lower Hudson River Estuary. Three P. australis-dominated sites (erosional creekbank, depositional creekbank, interior) were sampled for nekton using bottomless lift nets during day and night spring high tides during the months of July, August, and September, 1998. Hydrology data were collected for ten continuous days during each sampling period and included mean flooding depth, duration, and frequency for the three sites. Species captured on the marsh surface included Fundulus heteroclitus (common mummichog), Palaemonetes pugio (dagger-blade grass shrimp), Callinectes sapidus (blue crab), and Uca minax (brackish water fiddler crab). Results indicate that nekton and macrobenthos are using all areas sampled, and measured densities are comparable to those measured in some non-P. australis dominant wetlands elsewhere on the Hudson River. Although no strong correlation was made between nekton densities and hydrology, definite patterns were observed in the data. The results indicated that additional variables, such as geomorphology, might interact with hydrology to influence nekton use of the marsh surface. Although exact mechanisms controlling spatial variation of nekton use within P. australis stands still need to be elucidated, P. australis does seem to serve as nekton habitat.

AB  - The social interaction and behavioral activities of a population of fiddler crabs, Uca crenulata, located in the "Aqua Hedionda" lagoon in Carlsbad, California, is the subject of this study. Variations in environmental factors as well as seasonal behavioral changes cause an important fluctuation in the male to female ratio and in population density. A daily and seasonal variation is observed in the different behavioral activities displayed by the crab colony and are caused by biotic and abiotic environmental factors and by intrinsic hormonal changes. A male color variation from dark to light is related to behavioral changes during the breeding season. This lightening of the carapace, most likely caused by sexual hormones, is a thermoregulatory advantage for the mating male. Studies of the waving behavior of the light colored male in presence of a female, shows wave periods ranging from 1 to 5 seconds. The rate of the wave's major component corresponds to the optimum stimulus speeds (30-50 degrees/sec.) of a rate sensitive neuron found in the optic nerve of the crabs. These results show a strong relation between behavioral data obtained on the field and physiological data concerning movement and rate selective neurons in the eye of the crab U. crenulata. The identification of 9 different stages in the egg development of U. crenulata as well as the time necessary to complete the incubation shows that the breeding cycle length is 2 weeks.

AB  - The effects of the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, serotonin) uptake inhibitor, fluoxetine, and the 5-HT receptor blocker, LY53857, on red pigment migration induced by 5-HT and iproniazid in the fiddler crab, Uca pugilator, were determined. Fluoxetine potentiated and LY53857 antagonized (a) 5-HT- and iproniazid-induced red pigment dispersion in crabs kept on a white background, (b) the accelerated rate of red pigment dispersion that occurs in iproniazid-injected intact crabs transferred from a white to a black background, and (c) the decreased rate of red pigment concentration that occurs in ipronizaid-injected intact crabs transferred from a black to a white background. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that 5-HT triggers the release of red pigment-dispersing hormone in Uca pugilator.

AB  - Physiological, reproductive, and behavioral studies were conducted to determine the sublethal effects of contaminant exposure on Uca pugnax in two New Jersey marshes. Total lipids and lipid classes were examined in male crabs to examine the relationship between contaminant exposure and lipid variability. Lipids were examined seasonally, during various molt cycle stages, and after a 28-day reciprocal transplant exposure study. Seasonally, lipids were significantly different between months and although differences in total lipids and classes occurred between sites, results were not statistically different. During the molt cycle, total lipids and lipid classes differed between sites and R-categories. For the exposure study, total lipids were similar between sites and treatments while phospholipids increased with exposure to clean sediment. It is not clear whether contaminants influenced lipid composition but natural lipid fluctuations occur seasonally and during the molt cycle. Fecundity and larval morphology were examined to determine the effects of contaminant exposure on reproductive endpoints of field-collected organisms. Mean fecundity was higher at the contaminated site but crabs were slightly larger at this site which may have contributed to fecundity differences. Abnormal larvae were observed at both sites although the proportion of abnormal larvae was higher at the contaminated site. Hypopigmented eyes and hydropsy were the most common abnormalities at the contaminated site while hydropsy was the most common at the non-contaminated site. These morphological abnormalities were unspecific pathologies likely manifested as a general response to pesticides and metals. Oophagy was quantitatively documented for U. pugnax from both sites in a site comparison study and a feeding study. For the site comparison study, egg ingestion was typically greater at the non-contaminated site, although statistically the sites did not differ. Similarities in oophagy between sites indicate that contaminants do not appear to influence oophagy. For the feeding study, crabs from both sites still ingested eggs even when food pellets were offered although pellet ingestion was higher than egg ingestion for both sites. Egg ingestion in the site comparison study was similar to egg ingestion in the feeding study. This similarity in egg ingestion between the two studies indicates that the presence of food does not decrease or stop egg ingestion.

AB  - The costs of reproduction in brachyurans are reviewed. In both sexes a number of aspects of reproductive behaviour and physiology can result in higher mortality and/or slower growth. Mortality can be increased by the greater exposure or the reduced mobility of the crabs: these are illustrated by selected examples, but there is a dearth of quantitative data. Slower growth can result from reduced feeding, or the diversion of resources to reproduction. These have been better quantified. The investment by females in egg production is examined in detail. In free living crabs investment per brood in dry weight terms ranges from 3-21%, with a mean of about 11%. This investment is constrained by body morphology. However, in commensal/ parasitic crabs the value rises to 60-90%: reasons for this are discussed. Many crabs produce more than one brood per year, and annual investment rises with brood number, though with some trade off. For temperate free living species annual investment ranges from 6-64%, with a mean of 22%. However tropical species produce more broods, and annual investment can reach 250%. In both temperate and tropical regimes there is a higher annual investment by commensal/parasitic species, of up to 470%. Priorities for future research are outlined.

AB  - Biochemical composition of ovary and hepatopancreas tissues in wild populations of Uca tongisignalis and Uca nr. mina-v were monitored during the reproductive season. Total lipid (concentration and content), C (carbon), N (nitrogen). and C:N ratios of the ovary and hepatopancreas were quantified over the course of ovarian maturation. Ovary lipid and C concentration varied significantly over the course of ovarian maturation for both species, but there was no relationship between lipid concentration or hepatopancreas content and the stage of ovarian development in females. Hepatopancreatic lipid and C concentration did not differ between sexes of U. nr. minax. Lipid demands of ovarian maturation thus appear to be met in large part by increased dietary intake and not purely by translocating lipid stores from the hepatopancreas. In both Uca longisignalis and U. nr. minax, the color of the hepatopancreas may be used as an indicator of the lipid and C levels of the hepatopancreas. Cadmium-yellow and lemon-yellow hepatopancreas tissues had the highest lipid concentrations. No evidence could be found to demonstrate depletion of lipid or C concentrations in the hepatopancreas concomitant with ovarian maturation.

AB  - Artificial substrate collectors were used to sample settled brachyuran megalopae in Terreboune Bay, Louisiana. northern Gulf of Mexico. Three taxa, Callinectes sapidus, Uca spp., and Rhithropanopeus harrisii, were the most common settlers. Settlement occurred almost year-round, although settlement densities were highest in late summer and early fall. In 1990, all three taxa had several simultaneous settlement peaks; in 1991, one simultaneous Settlement peak occurred. Fewer C. sapidus and Uca spp. settled in 1991 than in 1990, but settlement abundance of R. harrissii was similar between years. Local weather events, such as heavy precipitation, may have influenced the lower abundances of C. sapidus and Uca spp. in 1991. The megalopae of C. sapidus and Uca spp., which re-invade the estuary from higher salinity offshore waters where larval development occurs, may have been more affected by the lower 1991 estuarine salinity values than the larvae of R. harrissii, which are retained within the estuary throughout larval development. Settlement of C. sapidus and Uca spp. was correlated with maximum tidal height, tidal amplitude, salinity, temperature, and lunar phase. In 1990, settlement of C. sapidus was correlated with lunar declination cycles, settlement peaks occurred during equatorial minimum amplitude tides. The settlement of R. harrisii was associated with tidal amplitude and lunar phase. Associations between environmental variables and settlement of megalopac were not consistent between die two years sampled. The opposing or reinforcing effects of various environmental variables on settlement, e.g., tidal height and rainfall, arc superimposed on long-term hydrologic cycles so that dramatically altered cycles of settlement occur among years.

AB  - The risk of predation is a strong force shaping many aspects of animal behaviour. Early detection and efficient avoidance strategies not only help prey to survive, but also limit the negative impact predation has on other aspects of their lives. The type of antipredator strategy an animal uses must depend on its ability to collect accurate information on the risks to which it is exposed. However, models attempting to predict when a prey animal should escape from an approaching predator often assume that the prey has accurate information on a predator's distance and direction of approach. To test whether such models could be applied to a prey animal with restricted sensory capabilities, I explored the predator avoidance behaviour of the fiddler crab Uca vomeris by approaching crabs with small dummies intended to mimic a hunting tern. The crabs responded strongly and reliably to the simple dummies. They were clearly sensitive to risk and responded more often and earlier, the further away they were from their refuge. The probability of response was most strongly influenced by how directly and therefore how closely the dummies approached the crabs and reached 100% for very direct approaches. Surprisingly, however, the crabs responded later when the dummies approached them more directly. I argue that this counterintuitive result reflects a lack of reliable information on the predator's distance and movement relative to the crab and its refuge, because like many small animals, crabs cannot measure the distance to a predator. I conclude that general models attempting to predict when animals should respond to an approaching predator need to incorporate the information that prey animals have available at the time of response.

AB  - The efficiency of predator avoidance strategies depends on the availability and accuracy of sensory information. Although vision can in principle provide instant information on a predator's position, direction of approach and identity, prey animals that face fast predators have to respond so early (close to the limits of detection) that visual cues are unreliable predictors of actual risk. This is a major problem for prey animals that have to balance predation risk with the cost of antipredator action. I investigated the visual cues fiddler crabs Uca vomeris use to decide when to run towards their burrow in response to an approaching (dummy) predator by running towards their burrow. The crabs did not always escape immediately when they first detected the dummy, but continued to monitor and assess its approach. The crabs relied on retinal image speed to trigger a home run. Retinal speed did not correlate well with the actual risk of predation because it confounded a predator's direction of approach with its speed and proximity. In an attempt to reconcile what is known about predator avoidance in semiterrestrial crabs, I propose a two-tier antipredator response system and discuss the crabs' multistage response strategy in the context of the associated costs and the availability of information. Multistage predator avoidance, which is common among prey animals, appears to be designed to improve the quality of information in an attempt to minimize the costs associated with predator avoidance responses.

AB  - Colour changes in fiddler crabs have long been noted, but a functional interpretation is still lacking. Here we report that neighbouring populations of Uca vomeris in Australia exhibit different degrees of carapace colours, which range from dull mottled to brilliant blue and white. We determined the spectral characteristics of the mud substratum and of the carapace colours of U. vomeris and found that the mottled colours of crabs are cryptic against this background, while display colours provide strong colour contrast for both birds and crabs, but luminance contrast only for a crab visual system. We tested whether crab populations may become cryptic under the influence of bird predation by counting birds overflying or feeding on differently coloured colonies. Colonies with cryptically coloured crabs indeed experience a much higher level of bird presence, compared to colourful colonies. We show in addition that colourful crab individuals subjected to dummy bird predation do change their body colouration over a matter of days. The crabs thus appear to modify their social signalling system depending on their assessment of predation risk.

AB  - Habituation is one of the most fundamental learning processes that allow animals to adapt to dynamic environments. It is ubiquitous and often thought of as a simple form of non-associative learning. Very little is known, though, about the rules that govern habituation and their significance under natural conditions. Questions about how animals incorporate habituation into their daily behaviour and how they can assure only to habituate to non-relevant stimuli are still unanswered. Animals under threat of predation should be particularly selective about which stimuli they habituate to, since ignoring a real threat could be fatal. In this study, we tested the response of fiddler crabs, Uca vomeris, to repeatedly approaching dummy predators to find out whether these animals habituate to potential predators and to test the selectivity of the habituation process. The crabs habituated to model predators, even though they were confronted with real predators during the same habituation process. They showed remarkable selectivity towards the stimulus: a simple change in the approach distance of the stimulus led to a recovery in their responses. The results strongly indicate that in the context of predator avoidance, habituation under natural conditions is highly selective and a stimulus is not defined just by its current sensory signature, but also its spatio-temporal history.

AB  - Optimal escape theory generally assumes that animals have accurate information about predator distance and direction of approach. To what degree such information is available depends not only on the prey's sensory capabilities but also on its behaviour. The structure of behaviour can strongly constrain or support the gathering of information. The ability of animals to collect and process information is therefore an important factor shaping predator avoidance strategies. Fiddler crabs, like many prey animals, escape predators in a multi-step sequence. In their initial response, they do not have accurate information about a predator's distance and approach trajectory and are forced to base their response decision on incomplete information that is not strictly correlated with risk. We show here that fiddler crabs gather qualitatively different visual information during successive stages of their escape sequence. This suggests that multi-stage anti-predator behaviours serve not only to successively reduce risk but also to increase the quality of information with regards to the actual risk. There are countless reasons why prey animals are not able to accurately assess risk. By concentrating on sensory limitations, we can quantify such information deficits and investigate how improving risk assessment helps prey optimise the balance between predation risk and escape costs.

AB  - Animals use several strategies for depth vision, reflecting the constraints imposed by body size, the structure of the visual system and the visual geometry of the environment(1). Arthropods in particular have restricted depth perception, because they are small and possess closely set, low-resolution compound eyes. Yet, here we show that fiddler crabs defending their burrows from conspecifics can judge how close other crabs are to their burrow. When confronted with small dummy crabs, the burrow owners assess the dummy's position and motion relative to their burrow and not relative to themselves-in other words, by using an allocentric rather than an egocentric frame of reference. Irrespective of their own distance from the dummy, the likelihood that the crabs rush back to defend their burrow increases strongly as the dummy approaches the burrow. In addition, the mean dummy-burrow distance at which the crabs respond is constant and independent of the dummy's direction of approach. We propose that to solve this sophisticated task of relative distance judgement, the crabs combine visual information on dummy position and direction with information on burrow location acquired during path integration(2). In doing so, the crabs, like humans(3), make clever use of the visual geometry of their environment.

AB  - When defending resources, animals need to reliably detect and identify potential competitors. Animals that live at high population densities would be expected to be efficient in this aspect of resource defence since the time lost in false alarms could be substantial and the failure of identifying a competitor could be very costly. How does an animal decide whether another animal is or is not a threat to a resource or a territory?Fiddler crabs [Uca vomeris (McNeill)] operate from burrows that they guard and defend vigorously against other crabs. The crabs live in dense populations, with many animals inhabiting one square metre of mudflat. We describe here the behavioural responses of foraging crabs to repeated presentations of small crab-like dummies approaching their burrows. We explore the relationship between the probability and the timing of burrow defence responses, the crab's behavioural state, and the visual appearance and direction of approach of the dummies. We find that the probability of response of resident crabs is independent of the relative position of crab and dummy but is strongly affected by the dummy's position and movement direction relative to the crab's burrow. The critical stimuli are the dummy's distance from the crab's burrow and whether the dummy is moving towards the burrow or not. The response distance (dummy-burrow distance) increases with the crab's own distance from the burrow, indicating that the crabs modify their assessment of threat depending on their own distance away from the burrow. Differences in dummy size and brightness do not affect the probability or the timing of the response.We discuss these results in the context of fiddler crab social life and, in a companion paper, identify the visual and non-visual cues involved in burrow defence.

AB  - Using crab-like dummies, we have shown previously that fiddler crabs [Uca vomeris (McNeill)] defend their burrows against intruders in a burrow-centred frame of reference. The crabs respond whenever an intruder approaches to within a certain distance of the burrow entrance, and this distance is independent of the approach direction. We show here that the crabs combine information from the path integration system on the location of their invisible burrow and visual information on the retinal position of an intruder to make this allocentric judgement. Excluding all alternative visual cues, we propose that the crabs employ a small set of matched visual filters to determine the relationship between a crab-like object and the invisible burrow. To account for the constantly varying distance between the crabs and their burrows, the state of the path integrator may select the appropriate one of these retinal 'warning zones'. We have shown before that burrow-owning fiddler crabs are extremely responsive to potential burrow snatchers, which we simulated with crab-like dummies moving across the substratum towards the burrow of residents. The crab's decision to respond to these dummies depends mainly on the spatial arrangement between itself, its burrow and the approaching dummy. The most important factor predicting response probability is the dummy's distance from the crab's burrow: the crabs are more likely to respond the closer the dummy approaches the burrow. The dummy-burrow distance not only determines the overall response probability but also the timing of burrow defence responses (i.e. when the crabs decide to react). Most interestingly, this response distance is independent of the dummy's direction of approach to the burrow. In addition, the crabs respond earlier to a dummy approaching their burrow if they themselves are further away from it, indicating that knowledge of their own distance from the burrow has an influence on their decision to respond. These results raise a number of interesting issues, which are the focus of this paper, regarding the cues and the information used by the crabs in burrow surveillance.

AB  - This study compared trade-offs between brood size and brood interval, as well as feeding activity and ovarian development during brood incubation, among fiddler crabs of three subgenera: Uca (Celuca) perplexa, U. (Thalassuca) vocans, and U. (Deltuca) dussumieri. Female U. perplexa remained in their burrows throughout incubation, and egg mortality was low despite relatively large brood sizes. These females did not feed during incubation, and their ovaries remained small until the eggs hatched. Female U. vocans fed actively on the surface during incubation, and egg mortality was high, despite relatively small brood sizes. Female U. dussumieri also fed actively during incubation, but their broods were very small and egg mortality was low. In the latter two species, the ovaries grew rapidly during incubation, and many females produced consecutive broods. Incubation in burrows may be adaptive for females that are exposed to severe heat stress and desiccation in the upper tidal flats, and a simple model demonstrates that large broods may be advantageous for females incubating broods in burrows because of shorter interruptions during feeding.

AB  - Assays of the Limulus polyphemus CNS material active as a chromatophorotropin in Uca pugilator (i.e., LUC) revealed LUC presence in larval, immature, and mature CNS, and in the CNS of both sexes of postlarval animals. No sexual difference in LUC levels was demonstrable. Assays of immature and mature CNS demonstrated higher LUC levels/mg CNS in the former, and assays of CNS from specific immature molt cycle stages showed LUC levels/mg CNS to be highest in postmolt and lowest in premolt. A unit of LUC activity was defined. Evidence suggesting that LUC may be a neurosecretory hormone in Limulus is discussed.

AB  - This is the first survey of trichomycetes for Vieques, Puerto Rico. Several types of arthropods, including millipedes, crabs, mosquitoes, bloodworms, amphipods and isopods, were collected from marine, freshwater and terrestrial habitats and their guts examined for the presence of trichomycetes. A new species of Enterobryus, which was found attached to the gut of the millipede Anadenobolus arboreus (Diplopoda), is described as Enterobryus viequensis sp. nov. We report the presence of Smittium culisetae in mosquito larvae and also provide information on two eccrinids associated with the fiddler crabs Uca rapax and U. burgersi and an amphipod.

AB  - Crabs exercised to fatigue showed a blanching and/or reddening of the body and legs. In Uca pugilator this effect was due to white and red pigment dispersion in the leucophores and erythrophores, respectively, and a black pigment concentration in the melanophores. The pigment movements were induced by factor(s) present in the blood of exercising Uca; blood (hemolymph) removed from an exercised crab and injected into the isolated leg segment of another individual causes pigment movements similar to those seen in intact fatigued crabs. The blood of exercised Uca also caused similar chromatophore changes in isolated leg segments of the crab Sesarma cinereum. The evidence suggests that blood-borne factor(s) related or identical to chromatophorotropins are released during vigorous exercise in crabs. The effects of these exercise factor(s) probably are secondary to possible effects on carbohydrate and lipid metabolism associated with exercise.

AB  - Allometric relationships of reproductive output were compared in 20 spp. [Cancer magister, Geryon quinquedens, Hemigrapsus nudus, H. oregonensis, Pachygrapsus crassipes, Sesarma reticulatum, Libinia emarginata, Loxorhynchus crispatus, Mimulus foliatus, Pugettia producta, P. richii, Scyra acutifrons, Uca minax, U. pugnax, Callinectes sapidus, Ovalipes ocellatus, Eurypanopeus depressus, Lophopanopeus leucomanus, Panopeus herbstii and Rhithropanopeus harrisii] from 7 families of brachyuran crabs from the east and west coasts of North America, using regression analysis of log reproductive parameter vs. log body weight. Comparisons of crabs spanning 4 orders of magnitude in body weight indicated that female body size was the principal determinant of reproductive output: 95% of the variance in brood weight, 79% of the variance in the number of eggs per brood, 63% of the variance in annual brood weight and 74% of the variance in annual fecundity were explained by body weight. Brood weight exhibited an isometric constraint to about 10% of body weight. Allometric limitations on space available for yolk accumulation in the body cavity appeared to be the main constraint on brood size. Ovum size increased significantly, but only slightly, with increasing body size. There was a significant trade-off between ovum size and the number of eggs per brood. There was no significant relationship between the number of broods per year and body size. The number of eggs per brood was significantly better than brood weight as a predictor of the number of broods produced per year by a species, indicating that demographic pressure on fecundity rather that energetic considerations is the primary selective mechanism influencing annual reproductive effort. Each of the 7 families of crabs exhibited trends toward distinct patterns for the suite of co-adapted reproductive traits.

AB  - A 5-year artificial-tracer study was used to mimic bioturbation of foraminifera in the back-barrier marshes of Folly and Rat Islands, South Carolina. Mixing rates decrease with subenvironment elevation, and decadal scale ecological signals and smaller hurricane deposits would not survive passage through the low-marsh mixing zone. However, the lower mixing rates in the high-marsh subenvironment allows for the preservation of such signals in the stratigraphic record. Bioturbation rates correlate poorly with plant density (primarily Spartina alterniflora). The Pearson correlation coefficient between mixing rate (1(m) in centimeters) and halophyte density (stems per square meter) is only 0.46, while the correlation between mixing and burrow density (apertures per square meter) is a much stronger 0.83. This corroborates earlier reports that spatiolateral variability in bioturbation is primarily a result of bioturbator (Uca spp.) preference for the low marsh and not halophyte distribution. Two factors contribute to the preservation of storm layers in the marshes behind Folly Island: (1) Hurricane deposits are laterally continuous and deposited across both low and high marsh, and (2) the coarser grain size of the washover sediments and the thickness of the larger storm deposits inhibit crab burrowing. Although the extensive paleostorm record from Folly Island appears to show a decrease in category 4 and 5 hurricanes through time, this record may reflect change in marsh paleo-subenvironment. In a transgressive setting, where a formerly high marsh is submerged into low marsh, the preservation potential of storm deposits decreases through time.

AB  - Studies on the post-larval morphology and growth of crabs can allow correct identification of their early life stages, supporting studies on phylogenetic relationships and ecological aspects. Nevertheless, little is known about the juvenile morphology of ocypodoid crabs worldwide. Uca cumulanta Crane, 1943 is a fiddler crab commonly found in the intertidal zone of the tropical and subtropical western Atlantic. This study describes the morphology of the first juvenile stage of U. cumulanta, its absolute and relative growth, and the appearance and development of its secondary sexual characters. The antennules of U. cumulanta show morphological peculiarities and could probably be used as a distinguishing feature for crabs of this genus. The maxillule and the maxilla have sets of setae forming specialised structures for sorting particles from the sediment. The absolute growth pattern differed statistically between sexes. The study of relative growth revealed differences in the relationships cheliped propodus length (CPL), cheliped propodus height (CPH), and abdomen width (AW) vs. carapace length (CL). These differences between sexes showed that males diverge from females (in the chelipeds) from 3.04 +/- 0.11 mm (VI juvenile stage), and females diverge from males (in the abdomen) from 3.84 +/- 0.13 mm (VII juvenile stage). The pleopods, rudimentary in the first stage, disappear in the second stage, and then arise in different numbers for each sex from the third juvenile stage on. The spoon-tipped setae found on the second maxilliped, which are used to sort food particles, are evident only from the fourth juvenile stage and increase linearly with carapace growth. The absence of these setae may be the reason why juveniles settle on organic-rich substrates where they can obtain food.

AB  - Some crustaceans show variations of their reproductive biology within their geographical distribution, and knowledge about such variations is important for the comprehension of their reproductive adaptations. This study compared two populations of the fiddler crab Uca uruguayensis from two locations on the south-western Atlantic coast: Ubatuba Bay, Sao Paulo, Brazil and Samborombon Bay, Buenos Aires, Argentina. The population features analysed were the body size variation (carapace width = CW) and the size at the onset of sexual maturity (SOM) in order to test the hypothesis that the size at SOM, should be the same in relative terms (RSOM), independently of the latitudinal position. In the Brazilian population the CW ranged from 4.18 to 11.60 mm for males and 3.90 to 9.80 mm for females, and in the Argentinean population from 3.60 to 14.10 mm for males and 2.85 to 12.00 mm for females. In the Brazilian population the SOM was 7.1 (RSOM 0.58) and 5.9 mm CW (RSOM 0.57) for males and females, respectively, and in the Argentinean population it was 7.0 (RSOM 0.42) and 6.75 mm CW (RSOM 0.53) for males and females, respectively. This fact is probably related to a great plasticity in the life history features of Uca uruguayensis under different environmental conditions.

AB  - The Kariega estuary is an open estuary which is about 18 km in length. The freshwater inflow into the estuary is very sporadic and consequently the water is often hypersaline at the head. Quantitative and qualitative sampling has been undertaken to describe the distribution and abundance of the macrobenthos along the estuary. Of the 107 species that have been recorded, 80% can be classified as euryhaline. One of the possible reasons for the high species diversity, when compared to other eastern Cape estuaries, is the growth of Zostera capensis along the entire length of the estuary. The major contributors to the macrobenthic biomass as the crustaceans, Cleistostoma edwardsii, C. algoense, Upogebia africana, Sesarma catenata and Uca urvillei and the bivalve Solen cylindraceus. The latter is particularly abundant in the middle reaches of the estuary where it can reach densities of 400 m-2. Its successful colonization is attributed to food availability and stable physical conditions within the estuary which in turn can be linked to the low freshwater input.

AB  - The cordgrass Spartina alterniflora Loisel is a foundation species critical to the establishment and maintenance of western Atlantic salt marshes. Although the factors regulating cordgrass growth along sheltered, fine-sediment shorelines have been exhaustively studied, less is known about the mechanisms that maintain cordgrass production in high-energy marshes characterized by sandy substrates. We investigated whether deposit-feeding fiddler crabs Uca pugilator Bosc and U. pugnax Smith can mediate local physical conditions and nutrient availability and stimulate cordgrass primary production on sandy marsh sediments. We experimentally removed fiddler crabs from 3 x 3 m plots in an exposed, sandy marsh in Wellfleet, Massachusetts, USA, and found that above- and belowground cordgrass biomass decreased by >53% and 50%, respectively, and above- and belowground nitrogen in cordgrass (g N m(-2)) decreased by >47% and 45% in fiddler crab removal plots compared to controls. Fiddler crab removal did not measurably influence sediment edaphic parameters, such as redox potential or waterlogging, suggesting that fiddler crabs enhance cordgrass productivity through nutrient deposition on sandy sediments and thus may be a critical component in the successful establishment and maintenance of salt marshes that develop along high-energy shores.

AB  - Phenotypic variation is fundamental to evolutionary change because it influences not only the connectivity of populations but also the adaptability and extinction susceptibility of taxa. Despite the potential importance of morphological variation in structuring evolutionary patterns, little is known about how relative differences in intraspecific variation and its geographic structure contribute to differences in species longevity. This study investigates the relationship between species-level variation, geography and longevity, first, by exploring patterns of geographic variation in extant and fossil arthropods using geometric morphometrics and, second, by quantifying relative variation, geographic range size, and duration in a clade of Upper Cambrian pterocephaliid trilobites from the Great Basin, USA. Results show that in extant North American fiddler crabs, species with more intraspecific variation are not necessarily more widespread but do express more geographic variation. In pterocephaliids, geographic range size and duration are positively correlated, but duration and intraspecific variation are negatively associated with one another. In particular, longer lived species tend to have smaller amounts of intraspecific variation and shorter lived species have more variation. Phylogenetic effects were explored and found not to determine the association between these variables, though the distribution of geographic range size, and to some extent, intraspecific variation, show phylogenetic signal. In light of the results from the fiddler crab study, one possible explanation for these results is that species with more variation tend to have shorter durations because the greater variation reflects higher rates of morphological evolution. These results have implications for the processes driving morphological evolution and how those processes pattern the distribution of species in the fossil record, both across time and space.

AB  - Studies documenting geographic variation in the morphology of numerous taxa suggest that species with greater geographic range should show more species-level morphological variation. We test this quantitatively using fiddler crabs (Crustacea: Uca) from the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of North America. Because fiddler crabs are intertidal, they are easy to study and their biology and ecology is well known. Collections made by the authors comprise several populations across each of nine species’ geographic range. Geographic ranges vary between species and may be quantified using coastline length. Morphological variation is measured using geometric morphometric shape analysis of the female crab carapace and quantified using disparity metrics developed for morphometric data. Principal components analysis shows concurrence between morphological similarity and taxonomy. Contrary to expectations, results show no relationship between morphological disparity and geographic range. In addition, disparity does not correspond with substrate affinity, number of biotic provinces occupied, or salinity tolerance. Because species with planktotrophic larvae have high dispersal potential, low disparity may be due to high gene flow between populations, obscuring local adaptation and implying minimal ecophenotypy. In fact, Uca species that show higher overall disparity also show some divergence among populations in morphospace. Finally, a negative relationship between disparity and geographic range is found with the inclusion of a species with nonplanktotrophic larvae (low dispersal potential). This suggests that the degree of morphological variation across a species is due to patterns of gene flow but cannot be estimated from geographic range size per se.

AB  - Species with larger geographic distributions are more likely to encounter a greater variety of environmental conditions and barriers to gene flow than geographically-restricted species. Thus, even closely-related species with similar life-history strategies might vary in degree and geographic structure of variation if they differ in geographic range size. In the present study, we investigated this using samples collected across the geographic ranges of eight species of fiddler crabs (Crustacea: Uca) from the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of North America. Morphological variation in the carapace was assessed using geometric morphometric analysis of 945 specimens. Although the eight Uca species exhibit different degrees of intraspecific variation, widespread species do not necessarily exhibit more intraspecific or geographic variation in carapace morphology. Instead, species with more intraspecific variation show stronger morphological divergence among populations. This morphological divergence is partly a result of allometric growth coupled with differences in maximum body size among populations. On average, 10% of total within-species variation is attributable to allometry. Possible drivers of the remaining morphological differences among populations include gene flow mediated by ocean currents and plastic responses to various environmental stimuli, with isolation-by-distance playing a less important role. The results obtained indicate that morphological divergence among populations can occur over shorter distances than expected based on dispersal potential.

AB  - Eyestalk-intact and eyestalkless fidller crabs, Uca pugilator, have similar temporal patterns of circulating serum ecdysteroids during proecdysis. Both groups of animals showed two distinct transient peaks of radioimmunoassay (RIA)-active ecdysteroids. Peak 1 occurred 3 weeks prior to ecdysis and preceded the onset of rapid proecdysial limb bud growth. Peak 2 was a larger peak that occurred a few days prior to ecdysis. Thin-layer chromatography profiles of the two peaks showed at least seven RIA-active compounds common to both peaks. The relative abundance of these compounds differed between the two peaks. The role of the eyestalks in control of circulating ecdysteroids was limited to maintenance of intermolt conditions. During proecdysis, the control of circulating ecdysteroid levels was located outside of the eyestalks. There was no correlation between limb bud growth rates and serum ecdysteroid levels during proecdysis.

AB  - The titer of ecdysone in hemolymph and the ratio of ecdysone to other radioimmunoassay(RIA)-active hemolymph ecdysteroids were compared to in vitro secretion of ecdysone in Y-organs removed from eyestalkless fiddler crabs at various times following eyestalk ablation. Using high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) and RIA it was established that ecdysone, 20-hydroxyecdysone, and RIA-active metabolites are present in the hemolymph at the end of anecdysis and throughout proecdysis. There was little correlation between in vitro secretory activity and total ecdysone in circulation. Ratios of ecdysone and 20-hydroxyecdysone changed during proecdysis as did the percentage of total RIA activity attributable to both. Positive correlations were observed between in vitro Y-organ secretion rates and amounts of ecdysteroids extracted from hemolymph and added to incubation media.

AB  - Comparison of the circulating steroids in the blood of crabs lacking neurosecretory eyestalk centers and crabs with those centers intact (but lacking several walking legs) has revealed differences in vivo that can be attributed to eyestalk factors. It is concluded that eyestalk factors (including the putative molt-inhibiting hormone, MIH): 1) exert control in vivo over production of 25-deoxyecdysone by the crab Y-organ, 2) control cyclic steroid production throughout anecdysis and parts of proecdysis and 3) are not solely responsible for the increased steroid production that occurs during late proecdysis. Using the data presented here and previously published data, a simple feedback model for the control of Y-organ activity is proposed. The model suggests that the Y-organs of the crab Uca pugilator are modestly active during anecdysis but become further activated during late proecdysis. The increased activation requires more than eyestalk removal and may involve additional extra-eyestalk factors.

AB  - Regeneration of walking legs in the fiddler crab Uca pugilator is most efficient when it follows autotomy (the reflexive loss of a limb). Closure of the wound and would healing occur immediately following autotomy and visible regeneration begins within a few days. Regeneration of the walking leg occurs in two distinct stages: The first stage, called Basal Growth, involves mitosis and differentiation. The second stage involves primarily protein synthesis and water uptake and is called Proecdysial Growth. Proecdysial Growth is, in part, under direct hormonal stimulation.

AB  - In the fiddler crab, Uca pugilator, regeneration of walking legs can be divided into two stages. The first stage, basal growth, begins with the formation of a limb primordium at the site of the wound. Over a time course related to the physiology and growth cycle of the animal, blastemal cells proliferate and differentiate into an intact miniature limb. The second stage, proecdysial growth, primarily represents a hypertrophy of the regenerate. The size of the limb bud increases due to muscle deposition and water uptake, with the emergence of a functional appendage occurring at the next molting of the body exoskeleton. The roles of ecdysteroids (and their receptors - UpEcRs) as well as growth factors such as retinoids (and their receptors - UpRXRs), and fibroblast growth factors in the regulation of limb regeneration will be discussed. Nucleic acid and immunological probes for receptor gene expression have been used to study these problems. For limb buds and other potential hormone-responsive tissues, steady-state receptor transcript levels relative to changes in hormone titer over the molt cycle have been established. Limb buds from both the basal and proecdysial stages of limb regeneration express UpEcR and UpRXR transcripts and immunoreactive fibroblast growth factors have been identified in early blastemas.

AB  - This paper summarizes recent work on various aspects of hormonal control of regeneration in the crustacean, Uca pugilator. Hormonal control in this crab is effected by means of the crustactean steroid hormones, the ecdysteroids. New evidence is presented supporting a role for the retinoid hormones, all-trans retinoic acid and 9-cis retinoic acid, in the control of regeneration in these animals. The possible role of fibroblast growth factors in organization of the limb blastema is explored and the similarities between vertebrate and invertebrate control of regeneration are discussed.

AB  - This paper summarizes our recent work on the histological, physiological and molecular aspects of limb regeneration in the fiddler crab Uca pugilator and new information is presented on mitotic activity in the blastema during the first days of blastemal organization. We also report for the first time the localization of vertebrate growth factor immunoreactivitty (FGF 2 and FGF 4) in the regenerating blastema, In the first part of this paper we review recent histological findings concerning the physical events that accompany autotomy of limbs and propose a new function for the autotomy membrane-the tethering of the regenerating pedal nerve to the walls of the coxa. In the second part of the paper we review our recent findings on the identification and characterization of the Uca ecdysteroid receptor (UpEcR, and its potential dimer partner, the retinoid- X-receptor, UpRXR), Using Uca-specific antibody probes raised in our lab, we have been able to identify specific cells in the early blastemal that express receptor proteins. The regenerating limb of the fiddler crab is responsive to both steroids and retinoids and mRNA for steroid and retinoid receptors are expressed in the regenerating limb buds during all stages of regeneration, The DNA and deduced amino acid sequences of the ecdysteroid receptor is very similar to the sequences of insect EcRs, while the retinoid receptor is similar to insect protein (ultraspiracle) in the DNA-binding domain, but closer to vertebrate RXRs in the ligand binding domain.

AB  - Regeneration of walking legs in the fiddler crab Uca pugilator represents true epimorphic growth since it involves organization of an undifferentiated blastema prior to regrowth of a new limb. Normal regeneration in Uca consists of two major stages-basal growth and proecdysial growth. One of the earliest events in the basal growth stage of regeneration is the secretion of cuticle by epidermal cells that migrate under the scab at the site of limb loss. When crabs are maintained in a 0.05 mM emulsion of retinoic acid (RA) in sea water during the first 2 weeks following autotomy, the pattern of cuticle secretion is disrupted in many limb buds. Limb buds on RA-treated crabs grow more slowly and are frequently malformed.

AB  - Ecdysteroids exert their effects through a heterodimer formed by the ecdysteroid receptor(EcR)and another member of the nuclear receptor superfamily. The partner is usually a homologue of the retinoid-X-receptor(RXR). In the fiddler crab, there are at least two isoforms of RXR that differ from one another by a 33 amino acid insert in the ligand binding domain. Here we look at the functional differences of these two isoforms. Both isoforms are expressed in limb bud tissues of the crab in specific patterns and heterodimerize with UpEcR in the absence of ligand. In vitro binding of the functional UpEcR to ecdysteroids is, however, affected by the UpRXRs. When partnered with the smaller isoform, UpEcR binds with three fold greater affinity than when paired with the larger isoform (Equilibrium Kd’s = 7.7 nM versus 21.8 nM). UpEcR (with either of the isoforms) binds to Ponasterone A (Pon A) with greatest affinity, but Pon A has no effect on dimerization. UpEcR dimerization to the larger isoform is significantly increased in the presence of high levels of 20-hydroxyecdysone. Endogenous ligands for the UpRXRs are present in the regenerating limb bud blastema. Retinoids and their metabolites have been isolated from blastemas and identified using HPLC, UV absorption, and mass spectrometry. The apparent Kd for the putative RXR ligands is very high (0.2- 0.4 mM). Putative RXR ligands at high concentrations have little or no effect on in vitro homodimerization. At low concentrations, however, 9-cis-retinoic acid does inhibit the ability of UpEcR to bind PonA, perhaps by reducing heterodimerization (through inducing homodimerization). These variations in dimer function will be discussed in light of variations in circulating steroids in crab hemolymph during the regeneration and molting cycles.

AB  - The pleiotropic effects of circulating ecdysteroids in the adult fiddler crab, Uca pugilator, during molting, regeneration, and reproduction are mediated by a limited number of receptor proteins. We hypothesize that hormonal effects in vivo may be the result of complex interactions between at least two receptor heterodimer conformations that differentially respond to multiple ecdysteroid/retinoid signals. Two splicing variants of the fiddler crab retinoid-X-receptor (UpRXR) differ from one another by the addition of a 33 amino acid insert in the ligand-binding domain. We show here that the ecdysteroid receptor in the fiddler crab (UpEcR) behaves differently depending upon the UpRXR isoform with which it is partnered. The two UpRXR variant partners for UpEcR confer slightly different responses in the binding of Ponasterone A (PA)-a naturally occurring ecdysteroid in the blood of Uca. UpRXR can bind 9-cis retinoic acid (9cRA) as well as terpenoids. 9cRA and the naturally occurring terpenoid, methyl farnesoate, influence the binding of PA to UpEcR/UpRXR dimers. Endogenous retinoids are found in the blastema of regenerating limbs of Uca and they (plus blood-borne terpenoids) may add additional levels of differential response by target tissues. Thus, the two sets of heterodimers tested here may represent different dynamic complexes whose properties are defined by the specific heterodimeric subunits involved and the specific ligands available.

AB  - Intraocular recordings were made from the eyestalks of dark- adapted fiddler crabs (Uca thayeri) during presentation of monochromatic light flashes of different wavelengths and intensities. Two types of signals were recorded in different experiments: slow potentials (electroretinogram) and fast potentials (spikes). The latter were also recorded in the presence of a continuous green or red adapting light. The resulting visual spectral-sensitivity curves, when fitted to rhodopsin-based visual pigment absorption spectra (from Dartnall nomograms), indicated the presence of two visual pigments, one with an absorption maximum near 430 nm, and the other with a peak absorption between 500 nm and 540 nm. The data also provided evidence for some differential bleaching of the pigments in the presence of a colored adapting light, but most of the adaptation effect was probably due to changes in screening pigment and neural desensitization or inhibition. These two observations suggest that an adequate substrate for color vision may exist in this and other species of fiddler crabs. The electroretinogram and spike-recording methods produced similar visual-sensitivity data, suggesting that latter technique, a much more efficient way of collecting data that is physiologically relevant, may be the method of choice for determining spectral sensitivity in crustaceans.

AB  - Seven species (eight populations) of sentinel crabs (genus Macrophthalmus) from the Japan coast and Uca vocans and Ocypode ceratophthalma. were examined electrophoretically for genetic variations in 13 enzymatic and one nonenzymatic protein comprising 17 loci. Most species were highly differentiated from each other (Nei's genetic distance, 0.29-1.63). The least genetic distance was found between M. japonicus and M. banzai, the genetic distinctiveness of the two taxa being supported by three divergent loci with no common allele. The genetic relationships among Macrophthalmus species differed greatly from those inferred from morphological features, with a UPGMA tree suggesting that the sub-genus Macrophthalmus is polyphyletic.

AB  - The authors examined fluctuation in microsomal ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD) activity in the hepatopancreas during the molting cycle of the fiddler crab, Uca pugilator. Results showed that microsomal EROD activity fluctuates significantly during the molting cycle, with the lowest enzymatic activity occurring in the late premolt stage. These results clearly show that molting physiology influences crustacean EROD activity, suggesting that when using crustacean EROD assays in evaluating pollution, only individuals from the same molt stage should be used. The authors propose that the high level of EROD activity in postmolt and intermolt stages is an additional mechanism crustaceans use to prevent any untimely rise in ecdysteroid levels.

AB  - Ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD) activity has widely been used as a biomarker for organic pollution. However, since much of crustacean physiology is cyclic, EROD activity could also fluctuate during the molting cycle, which would call into question the use of crustacean EROD as a biomarker for organic pollution without distinguishing molt stages of crustacean specimens. This study aimed to address a fundamental question in crustacean toxicology, that is, is crustacean EROD activity influenced by the molting physiology? Using the fiddler crab, Uca pugilator, as the model crustacean, we investigated whether microsomal EROD activity in the hepatopancreas fluctuates during the molting cycle. Results showed that microsomal EROD activity varies significantly during the molting cycle, with the lowest enzymatic activity occurring in late premolt stage. These results clearly show that crustacean EROD activity is influenced by the molting physiology, suggesting that when using crustacean EROD assays in evaluating pollution, only individuals from the same molt stage should be used. Based on an inverse relationship between EROD activity and ecdysteroid titers, we propose that the high level of EROD activity in postmolt and intermolt stages is an additional mechanism used by crustaceans to prevent any untimely rise in ecdysteroid levels.

AB  - Glutathione S-transferase (GST) in the hepatopancreas of crustaceans has been suggested as a biomarker for organic pollution. However, much of crustacean physiology is known to exhibit a cyclic characteristic because of the periodic shedding of the confining exoskeleton. The goal of this study was to determine whether hepatopancreatic GST activity varies during the molting cycle using the fiddler crab, Uca pugilator, as the model. Neither the molting cycle nor 20-hydroxyecdysone injection had a significant effect on hepatopancreatic GST activity, suggesting GST activity is not under control of the molting hormone in Uca pugilator.

AB  - We determined tidal, diel (day-night), and diurnal (day to day) patterns of occurrence for the summer zooplankton assemblage in an intertidal salt marsh basin at North Inlet Estuary, South Carolina. In one time series, 153 mu m pump and 365 mu m net collections were made every 1-2 h during four consecutive tidal cycles. Taxonomic composition remained unchanged throughout most of the 48-h period, but densities and proportionalities of individual taxa were highly variable. Recurring patterns of abundance were observed and taxon-specific relationships with the tidal and diel cycles were indicated. Zooplankton were not uniformly distributed within flooding-ebbing water masses and distributions could not be explained by simple passive advection with the tides. Diel differences in densities of copepods and bivalves resulted from behavioral responses to changing light conditions. Large pulses of crab and shrimp larvae originating from nocturnal hatching events within the intertidal basin exited but did not return during the next flood tide. Higher densities of postlarval decapods on flood tides indicated settlement and recruitment to the shallow basin. In a second time series, replicated collections of the 153 mu m and 365 mu m assemblages were made during the daytime ebb tide every 1-3 d from May through October 1991 to determine relationships between diurnal changes in depth, salinity, and temperature and zooplankton composition and abundance. Diurnal variations in densities and proportionalities were less than those observed during the 48-h study and patterns were not regular For most taxa, relationships between depth and abundance were the same in both time series. During periods of reduced salinity, densities of copepods, Uca zoeae, and barnacle nauplii decreased and densities of Uca megalopae and Penaeus postlarvae increased. However, zoeae emerged and postlarvae recruited throughout the 5-mo period, indicating that considerable flexibility in responses and tolerances existed within the populations. The diversity of life-history strategies and behavioral adaptations found among the zooplankton assures continuous occupation of flooded intertidal habitats. We suspect that the evolution and maintenance of temporally staggered recurring patterns of occurrence results in reductions in the competition for resources.

AB  - To test the hypothesis that crab larvae alter their swimming behavior, horizontally, in response to biochemical cues in the water, fiddler crab ( Uca pugnax ) and blue crab (Callinectes sapidus ) megalopae were video-recorded in a laminar-flow flume while putative cues were introduced and allowed to establish a gradient in the flow field. Specifically, changes in their horizontal orientation, distribution, and swimming speed were analyzed and compared across six different cue treatments---control (filtered offshore water) and five water-soluble exudates from biological sources: (1) conspecific adult, (2) conspecific megalopae, (3) interspecific megalopae, (4) predator, and (5) prey. The results showed that crab larvae can detect chemical cues in the ambient water column, and are sometimes able to discriminate between the cues and determine the direction of the cue source, adjusting aspects of their swimming behavior accordingly. In complement to this laboratory-based observation of larval swimming behavior, a field investigation was conducted to test the idea that maintenance of patches, across time and space, is influenced by swarming behavior of the larvae. Fiddler crab and blue crab patches were tagged with a satellite-tracked drifter and followed across days while taking both physical and biological samples in a 4.0 km x 4.5 km grid (alongshelf and across-shelf, respectively). This allowed observation of changes in the spatial dynamics of the patches (i.e., larval density, size, and shape) and physical conditions in and around them (e.g., salinity, temperature, flow). There was some overlap of the two species, but the movement, abundance, and coherence of their aggregations differed. A two-dimensional trajectory of the patches supported previous conceptual models and yielded the first demonstration that patches can actually remain intact while moving through a buoyant plume, which further supports the idea that patches are maintained throughout development. In addition, related numerical modeling conducted by other members of our research group revealed that typical larval patches are not characterized by equal across- and alongshelf dimensions, but instead are slender shapes that are aligned with salinity contours. The bio-physical data collected here failed, however, to completely explain how patches are maintained, specifically the possible role of larval swimming behavior in offsetting their physical dispersion. The laboratory study suggests some possible behaviors (e.g., increase in larval swimming speed) that could be involved, though physical components in the field seem to be dominant.

Changes in horizontal orientation, distribution, and swimming velocity were observed for six different cue treatments. Overall results show that crab megalopae can detect biochemical cues in ambient water and that they adjust their horizontal swimming behavior in response to these cues. The dominant response was a change in swimming velocity in the presence of a cue. While this response may affect the dynamics of larval patches, it is not clear if swimming in the horizontal plane has a substantial effect on the spatial aggregation of the larvae in the field.

AB  - Diurnally foraging planktivorous fishes are exceptionally dense in marshes worldwide, and larvae of most species of marsh crabs largely may escape predation in time and space by hatching during nocturnal maximum amplitude high tides (NMAHT) when they are rapidly transported to deeper waters under the cover darkness. Species that have long spines or other well-developed larval defenses may be less constrained to release larvae during this safe period. Three species of diurnally foraging planktivorous fishes (Menidia menidia, Fundulus heteroclitus, F. majalis) were very abundant and comprised nearly all of the fishes collected in Flax Pond salt marsh in New York, USA, during the summer of 1994. Four species of crabs (Sesarma reticulatum, Uca pugnax, U. pugilator, Dyspanopeus sayi) also were abundant there and released larvae from mid June to September. These crabs did not release larvae randomly, rather larval release peaked during NMAHT when strong ebb tides transported 97.3 % of the larvae from the marsh by the following day. Larvae that were released during nocturnal minimum amplitude high tides were transported from the marsh less effectively (84.5 %). Only 0.37 % of larvae remained in the marsh following the molt to the second instar. Larval release by D. sayi was weakly synchronized with the tidal amplitude cycle, and these larvae were transported from the marsh least effectively. Although D. sayi larvae that were released during NMAHT were transported from the marsh nearly as effectively as were the other species (95.6 % vs 98.0 % of S. reticulatum and 99.9 % of Uca spp.), more of them were released near nocturnal minimum amplitude high tide when transport was least effective (58.2 % vs 86.0 % of S. reticulatum and 87.5 % of Uca spp.). Transport of D. sayi larvae from the marsh may have been slowed further by the tidal vertical migrations undertaken by these larvae. In feeding trials conducted in the marsh, M. menidia and F. heteroclitus ate about half as many newly released D. sayi larvae as S. reticulatum and U. pugnax larvae (57.2 % vs 26.1 % of S. reticulatum and 32.9 % of U. pugnax). Long spines may have deterred predation on D. sayi larvae and may reduce selection for rapid transport of these larvae from the marsh. Recruitment to Flax Pond occurred during flood tides, especially strong flood tides, at night when transport to adult habitats was maximal and predation by fishes was minimal. Megalopae of all study species recruited regularly in the same relative proportions that they were released throughout the entire reproductive season, even though larvae of some of the study species (S. reticulatum, D. sayi) Likely develop entirely in adjacent Long Island Sound whereas others (Uca spp.) disperse through the sound and onto the continental shelf. This suggests that reproductive and larval behaviors largely overcame mortality during the planktonic phase of the Life cycle and coupled production to recruitment, regardless of whether or not recruits primarily originated from local populations. Thus, predictable variation in predation by planktivorous fishes exerts strong selective pressure on crabs that release larvae in productive shallow waters, and suites of reproductive and larval behaviors apparently have evolved that favor migration between adult and larval habitats.

AB  - Estuarine crab larvae are often hatched into shallow salt marshes and may remain near the water's surface while dispersing from shorelines. Residence in surface waters or entrapment in shallow backwaters of marshes may expose larvae to damaging ultraviolet radiation-B (UVBR, 280-320 nm). To determine the effects of UVBR exposure on larval survival, larvae of three species of salt marsh crabs, Uca pugnax (Smith, 1870), Sesarma reticulatum (Say, 1817), and Dyspanopeus sayi (Smith, 1869), were reared for 4 days in UVBR-transparent and UVBR-opaque containers that were suspended 10 and 25 cm below the sea surface in a shallow salt marsh located on Long Island, New York, USA. UVBR, UV-A radiation (UVAR, 320-400 nm) and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR, 400-700 nm) were measured from the surface to the bottom of the water column during the course of five replicate trials. UVBR, UVAR and PAR were all rapidly attenuated in the turbid salt marsh. Nevertheless, UVBR decreased larval survival of all three species. Survival of Sesarma reticulatum larvae decreased as UVBR exposure increased during the course of the experiment. Survival of Uca pugnax larvae initially declined but stabilized thereafter. Survival of Dyspanopeus sayi larvae did not decline during the first day of the experiment but it decreased each day thereafter. Therefore, UVBR may quickly kill newly hatched larvae that become trapped in the marsh or remain within 1 m of the water's surface. However, larvae in Flax Pond were released during nocturnal ebb tides, and 97.7% of newly-hatched larvae were flushed from the marsh before daybreak. Thereafter, larvae may avoid the top 1 m of the water column during the daytime (U. pugnax and D. sayi) or may reside at depth throughout the day (S. reticulatum). The two surface oriented species also may be protected from UVBR by photorepair mechanisms or mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs).

AB  - Male and female animals are not always complicit during reproduction, giving rise to coercion. One example of a system that is assumed to involve sexual coercion is the mate herding behaviour of fiddler crabs: males push females towards the home burrow with the goal of forcing copulation at the burrow entrance. We recorded and analysed in detail the courtship behaviour of a North Australian species of fiddler crab Uca elegans. Courtship was composed of four main phases: broadcast waving, outward run, herding and at burrow display. During interactions males produced claw-waving displays which were directed posteriorly towards the female and which varied in timing and structure depending on the courtship phase. We suggest that courtship herding in U. elegans is driven primarily by mate choice for the following reasons, (1) females can evade herding, (2) no other reproductive strategies were observed, (3) males broadcast their presence and accompany courtship with conspicuous claw waves, and (4) the behaviour ends with the female leading the male into the home burrow. As an alternative function for herding in U. elegans we suggest that the behaviour represents a form of courtship guiding, in which males direct complicit females to the correct home burrow.

AB  - Animals with limited neural processing power require simple control systems for guiding behaviour. The fiddler crab Uca elegans uses both allocentric cues from the visual environment and egocentric cues from path integration to guide movements during courtship. As part of their courtship system, male U. elegans intercept moving females in a behaviour termed outward run. These outward runs require males to track the position of females visually, navigate towards them, and manoeuvre themselves into a position ready for subsequent courtship activity. Using digital video cameras positioned above the mud. at, we recorded and analysed 22 naturally occurring outward runs. By measuring the visual location of females from the viewpoint of males, we found that, during the approach, males maintained the target female position within a specific region of the posteriolateral visual field. Also, outward-running males moved on average 5.5 cm/s faster than target females. This led us to propose a relatively simple control system for guiding the outward run which accounts for the observed tracking behaviour. The control system is based on two simple rules. (1) Move towards the target female while maintaining her retinal image within a narrow strip of the posteriolateral visual field. (2) As you approach, move the fixation point for the female's image slowly towards a more posterior position. These guidance rules do not require the males to adjust their speed in relation to the female. As long as they are faster than the female, the interception will be successful.

AB  - Effective communication is critically dependent on the successful transfer of information and, because environmental and social conditions can affect signal transmission, animals should be able to adjust their signals to optimize reliability. We show, apparently for the first time in a movement- based signal, that visual displays are adjusted with respect to the distance of signal receivers. Not only does this show the ability of the fiddler crab to judge distance, but this also shows that signalling is context dependent on surprisingly. ne spatial and temporal scales. We elicited courtship behaviour in the crabs with tethered females and simultaneously recorded the displays of males from above and from crab- eye level. As females approached, males increased signal intensity by shortening display duration and altered signal form by reducing the lateral movement component of the waving signal. We suggest that males tune their waving display depending on receiver distance ( a) to balance energetic costs with reproductive benefits, ( b) to alter the information content of the signal and ( c) to avoid signal misinterpretation. Such fine- scale context sensitivity is likely to be far more widespread in animal communication than hitherto recognized from similar signal modi. cations in auditory communication.

AB  - Polarisation vision is used by a variety of species in many important tasks, including navigation and orientation (e.g. desert ant), communication and signalling (e.g. stomatopod crustaceans), and as a possible substitute for colour vision (e.g. cephalopod molluscs). Fiddler crabs are thought to possess the anatomical structures necessary to detect polarised light, and occupy environments rich in polarisation cues. Yet little is known about the capabilities of their polarisation sense. A modified polarisation-only liquid crystal display and a spherical rotating treadmill were combined to test the responses of fiddler crabs to moving polarisation stimuli. The species Uca vomeris was found to be highly sensitive to polarised light and detected stimuli differing in e-vector angle by as little as 3.2 deg. This represents the most acute behavioural sensitivity to polarised light yet measured for a crustacean. The occurrence of null points in their discrimination curve indicates that this species employs an orthogonal (horizontal/vertical) receptor array for the detection of polarised light.

AB  - To respond appropriately to communication signals, animals must have the ability to decipher signal meaning. At a basic level, interpreting the difference between territorial and courtship signals can be vital for the survival and reproduction of social animals. Male and female fiddler crabs communicate with claw-waving displays, but the function of these waves remains uncertain. Species differ in the context in which they wave: Some wave during courtship, some during territorial defence and some during both. In this paper, we provide evidence that males of an Australian species of fiddler crab, Uca perplexa, use two different types of claw waving display, lateral and vertical. Lateral waves are employed solely in a courtship context, whilst vertical waves are employed during courtship as well as territorial interactions. Using video recordings, we show that lateral waves were produced spontaneously (broadcast), and their frequency increased only in the presence of female wanderers. Vertical waves were not broadcast but were elicited by male wanderers during agonistic interactions and female wanderers during close range courtship. Male resident U. perplexa were able to discriminate the sex of wandering crabs on the mudflat at distances of 32 cm. During all resident-wanderer interactions, residents attempted to maintain a position directly between the wanderer and the home burrow and orient themselves to face females and to present the major claw towards males. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of the multiple use of waving displays in a fiddler crab species.

AB  - Fiddler crabs use elaborate, species-specific claw-waving displays to communicate with rivals and mates. However, detailed comparative studies of fiddler crab signal structure and structural variations are lacking. This paper provides an analysis of the claw-waving displays of seven Australian species of fiddler crab, Uca mjoebergi, U. perplexa, U. polita, U. seismella, U. signata, U. elegans and U. vomeris. We used digital video to record and analyse the fine-scale spatiotemporal properties of these movement-based visual signals. We found that the structure and timing of the displays is species-specific, exhibiting inter-specific differences that follow phylogenetic relationships. The displays showed intra-specific variation according to individual identity, geographic location and fine-scale behavioural context. The observed differences and variations are discussed in the light of the evolutionary forces that may shape their design.

AB  - Estuaries are biologically diverse systems, especially in the spatial relationships between macrobenthos and their food sources. In a mangrove estuary in northern Taiwan, spatial patterns of organic matter flows from primary producers and detritus derived from vascular plants to macrofaunal polychaetes and crabs were examined using stable isotopes of carbon and sulfur. Sampling was conducted mainly from August 1996 to May 1997 on 2 mud flats, I on a tidal creek (Creek site) and the other on a tidal riverbank (River site). The VC and VS ranges at the River site were broader than those at the Creek site (delta(13)C: -28.3 to -13.6 parts per thousand vs - 28.3 to -19.3 parts per thousand, delta(34)S: 8.1 to 15.9 parts per thousand VS 7.1 to 13.1 parts per thousand). This is due to the presence of a C4 plant, the cogon grass Imperata cylindrica at the River site. Although the mangrove Kandelia candel was the largest source of carbon at both study sites, our isotopic analyses showed that it was not as important a source of nutrition to consumers as particulate organic matter (POM), benthic microalgae, and cogon grass. When their VC and OS values were plotted against each other, the 4 crab and 2 polychaete species were differentiated into several distinguishable assemblages which correspond to sites where they reside. The conspecific nereids and fiddler crabs utilize different food sources when inhabiting different sites. Stable isotopic analyses revealed 3 kinds of feeding interactions at the Creek site. Along with detritivory (which uses POM) and herbivory (which uses microalgae), carnivory occurs between the grapsid crab Helice formosensis and its sabellid prey. Thus, trophic interactions are more complicated and diverse at the Creek than at the River site where detritivory (using POM plus detritus of cogon grass) is prevalent. A wider range of delta(13)C and delta(34)S values in a food web does not necessarily mean that the macrobenthos have a greater food variety, nor can one interpret how diverse an estuarine food web is. Instead, the diversity of an estuarine food web is characterized by a series of factors related to spatial differences in flow regimes, the availability and relative contribution of food sources, the opportunistic dietary choices of consumers, and consequently, spatially varying trophic interactions.

AB  - Using a lattice-automaton model, we simulate the effects of fiddler crabs on the distribution of excess Pb-210 in marsh sediments. Three previously-identified modes of bioturbation are investigated: (1) removal-and-fill, where material is excavated to the sediment-water interface and burrows, when abandoned, are subsequently filled by surface material, (2) removal-and-collapse, where the infilling occurs by collapse of the burrow walls, and (3) partial-compaction-and-collapse, where part of the excavated sediment is packed into the burrow wall and abandoned burrows subsequently collapse. These various mixing modes lead to somewhat different laterally-integrated Pb-210(cx) profiles, which are also influenced by burrowing frequency, burrow dimensions, fraction of surface material replaced by new sediment (regeneration), and the fraction of material compacted during burial. Using parameters from a previous study in a South Carolina marsh, we find that data from low-marsh sites are best predicted by the partial-compaction-and-collapse process; this is consistent with the observation that burrow casts indicate far more material is excavated than is deposited as pellets at the sediment-water interface. The profile from the high-marsh site is best simulated by removal-and-fill mixing, with 50% regeneration of material at the sediment-water interface; this is consistent with less frequent flooding at this site. We have also calculated the exchange function for each of these mixing modes and show that they are highly asymmetric, indicating that the mixing is not diffusive. Only in the case of partialcompaction-and-collapse does the exchange function approach a diffusive form when the excavation rate decreases, i.e., the probability of compaction increases.

AB  - This study determined the general distribution, zonation and habitat preference of intertidal Brachyuran crabs along the coast of Sarawak. Intertidal surveys catalogued a total of 16 Brachyuran crab species, only three of which were previously recorded in East Malaysia. Specimens included species from the families Ocypodidae (12 species), Grapsidae (four species), and Calappidae (one species). Crabs from the family Ocypodidae consisted of two species of Dotilla, one species of Macrophthalmus, three species of Ocypode, one species of Scopimera, and five species of Uca. Crabs from the family Grapsidae consisted of one species of Metaplax, and three species of Sesarma: A species of Matuta was the only crab from the family Calappidae. This data contributes to the information on species richness and distribution of brachyuran crabs in the region.

AB  - Laboratory experiments were designed to investigate key stimuli used by blue crabs, Callinectes sapidus, when selecting prey. Results were compared with behaviour predicted, or assumed, by optimal foraging theory. Both live prey and simple models were employed to monitor the responses of blue crabs foraging either in tactile mode, as when feeding on marsh mussels, Geukensia demissa, attached to the substratum, or in visual mode, as when foraging on fiddler crabs, Uca spp., moving over the substratum.

We suggest that foraging blue crabs simply respond to the strongest stimuli received from the prey. Items are rejected after a certain persistence time if the attack is proving unsuccessful. Persistence time is adjusted, through experience, to expectations of local prey quality or availability. The integrated result of this key-stimulus mechanism of prey selection will be a close match to diets predicted by other behavioural models, including that based on optimal foraging theory.

AB  - Optimality reasoning has proven to be a powerful tool in understanding the behaviour of animals when the outcome of a situation depends on the interests of only a single party. However, the outcome of many situations is under the partial control of more than one individual, each with a self-interest that may conflict with the interests of the other(s).This is particularly true during predator-prey interactions. The very nature of the relationship between hunter and hunted ensures that the two will usually have a different preference, but only partial control, over the outcome of their behavioural interactions. In such situations, a game-theoretic approach is required. Despite this, there have been relatively few applications of game theory to the study of predator-prey interactions. I examine three scenarios in which evolutionary game theory provides novel insight into the behaviour of predators and their prey. The first is a 'habitat selection game' in which both predators and prey are free to choose a habitat in which to live. This model produces several new insights, notably that, in the absence of interference effects, the density of prey in a habitat is determined solely by the inherent 'riskiness' of that habitat and is unaffected by habitat productivity. Next, I present a general theory of strategic biological communication, including a 'signalling game' which is relevant to pursuit-deterrent signalling between predators and prey. Among other things, this theory demonstrates that honest pursuit-deterrent signalling is a form of cooperation between predators and prey and that biological signals need not be handicaps to be evolutionarily stable. Finally, I consider the 'waiting game' that occurs whenever a prey responds to the presence of a predator by retreating into a shell or burrow, or by taking refuge in some other way that guarantees its safety but prevents further information from being obtained about the predator's continued presence. I first present a model which makes various predictions, including that the time the prey will wait before re-emerging will be quite variable and follow a highly skewed distribution. I then present empirical support for the model from observed interactions between the black-bellied plover ( Pluvialis squatarola ) and the fiddler crab Uca princeps .

AB  - Fiddler crabs (Uca sp.) provide a good example of prey whose antipredator behaviour places them in a 'waiting game' contest with their predators. After visually detecting an approaching predator, fiddler crabs typically retreat into a burrow. When this occurs, a crab must decide how long to wait for the predator to depart before re-emerging and potentially exposing itself to attack. Similarly, the predator must decide how long to wait for the crab to re-emerge before departing in search of other foraging opportunities. Hugie (2003, Behavioral Ecology, 14, 807-817) recently presented an analysis of such a predator-prey waiting game. The model makes various predictions, including ones about the general shape of each player's waiting distribution (the distribution of waiting times one would expect to observe for individuals in that role). I present an empirical test of the waiting game during interactions between the black-bellied plover, Pluvialis squatarola, and the fiddler crab Uca princeps. As predicted by the model, the plovers' waiting distribution resembled a negative exponential function, whereas the waiting times of crabs were more variable and followed a positively skewed distribution. As further predicted, very little overlap occurred between the two players' waiting distributions and plovers rarely outwaited crabs. I conclude that the waiting decisions of the black-bellied plover and U. princeps support the general predictions of Hugie (2003) and result from a predator-prey waiting game.

AB  - Adult female Uca pugilator were allowed to make spontaneous choices during low tide toward lights differing in intensity only. The response patterns for 3010 trials shows that crabs consistently approached the dimmer of two white lights, but if two blue or two red-orange lights were presented, the brighter light was approached more frequently. The responses toward coloured lights disappeared when identical tests were performed at high tide.

AB  - The combination of relatively impermeable clay minerals and an enrichment of organic matter result in the rapid depletion of oxygen within a few mm depth in saltmarsh sediment, and thus most organic matter remineralization (microbial respiration) occurs under anoxic conditions. Using a stratified random sampling design over an entire marsh basin, we investigated the major anaerobic respiration processes in 3 different saltmarsh habitats at Skidaway Island, GA: the short form of Spartina alterniflora (SS), the tall form of S. alterniflora (TS), and unvegetated, bioturbated creekbank (CB), where the mud fiddler crab (Uca pugnax) is the dominant macrofauna. Geochemical analysis of porewater and solid phase constituents revealed that the SS site experienced highly reducing conditions with two orders of magnitude higher sulfide inventories (1.886 mmol m-2) than TS (0.003 mmol m-2) and CB (0.005 mmol m-2), respectively Reactive Fe(III) inventories at TS (2,937 mmol m-2) and CB (5,990 mmol m-2) were up to 5 and 10 times higher than at SS (562 mmol m-2). Sulfate- and Fe(III)-reduction rates were highest at the TS site. Incubations and intact core experiments indicated that sulfate reduction accounted for 94% (SS), 31% (TS), and 67% (CB) of total anaerobic respiration. There was no detectable Fe(III) reduction at SS, but Fe(III) reduction accounted for up to 50% and 28% of carbon oxidation at TS and CB, respectively. Our results indicate that though sulfate reduction is predominant, microbial Fe(III) reduction makes a substantial contribution to organic matter remineralization on a marsh-wide basis. Iron(III)-reducing bacteria are able to outcompete the sulfate-reducing bacteria for available carbon substrates at the TS and CB sites where aeration via plant roots and macrofanual burrows act to enhance the availability of electron acceptors through re-oxidation reactions. Abundances of sulfate- and Fe-reducing bacteria, determined using a most probable number (MPN) enrichment culture method, confirmed the relative significance of microbial respiration processes at each site.

AB  - Different environmental and sex conditions induce phenotypic responses (behavioural, morphological and physiological) in many species. The crab Cyrtograpsus angulatus inhabits contrasting intertidal habitats, such as rocky shores and salt marshes, where they are exposed to a wide diversity of predators. However, their anti-predator responses differ substantially between these two habitats: while crabs in the salt marshes use or built burrows or they simply hide by burying in the sediment into the tidal channels, on rocky shores they find shelter below rocks, inside crevices or under seaweeds in tidal pools. Considering that refuges in salt marshes can be adjusted by the crabs according to their size and the morphology, while in rocky shores they have to fit in the available refuges, we expect that the body shape differs between individuals from each intertidal habitat. In order to test this hypothesis, we collected male and female crabs from a salt marsh and a rocky shore, separated by 3km, in San Jose Gulf, Patagonia, and compared the carapace shapes using geometric morphometric methods. The results showed that carapace shape variation is explained by the interaction between sex and habitats. In both sexes, the mean carapace shape on the rocky shore is more slender and more lengthened than in the salt marsh individuals. Furthermore, the posterior margin of the female carapaces was wider than that of male carapaces, which were slender and more rounded posterolaterally, independent of the intertidal habitat.

AB  - A pair of rosette glands (one of the tegumental glands in crustaceans) is present at the root of the dorsal spine of the thorax in mature embryos of the estuarine crab Sesarma haematocheir. Each rosette gland is spherical, 45-50 mum in diameter. This gland consists of three types of cells: 18-20 secretory cells, one central cell, and one canal cell. The secretory cells are further classified into two types on the basis of the morphology of secretory granules. There are 17-19 a cells, and only one b cell per rosette gland. Am a cell contains spherical secretory granules of 2-3 mum in diameter. The granules are filled with highly electron-dense materials near the nucleus but have lower electron-density near the central cell. The secretory granules contained in the b cell have an irregular shape and are 1-1.5 mum in diameter. The density of the materials in the granules is uniform throughout the cytoplasm. The secretory granules contained in both the a and b cells are produced by the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Materials in the granules are exocytotically discharged into the secretory apparatus inside the secretory cell, sent to the extracellular channels in the central cell, and secreted through the canal cell. The rosette gland can be distinguished from the epidermal cells 2 weeks after egg-laying and the gland matures just before hatching. Materials produced by this gland are secreted after hatching and secretion continues through five stages of zoeal larvae. These rosette glands were never found in the megalopal larva. Rosette glands are found in the embryos of Sesarma spp. and Uca spp. In other crabs, tegumental glands are also found at the same position as in the embryo of S. haematocheir, but the fine structure of their glands is largely different from that of the rosette gland. On the basis of the morphology of secretory cells (a-g cell types), the tegumental glands of a variety of crab embryos can be classified into four types, including rosette glands (type I-IV). The function of these tegumental glands is not yet known, but different types of the gland seem to reflect the phylogeny of the crabs rather than differences of habitat. (C) 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - A number of zoeal larvae of crabs possess tegumental glands at the root of the dorsal spine. These tegumental glands are classified into four types (type I-IV) on the basis of the fine structure of secretory cells. Type I consists of radially arranged two types of secretory cells (a and b), a central cell, and a canal cell. Type I gland is occurred in Sesarma spp. and Uca spp. The other types of glands are clearly different from the rosette gland. type II contains two types of secretory cells (c and d) which gather in a mass. Type II is found in two species of Xanthide. Type III has two types of secretory cells, but these secretory cells are different from those of type II. Type III is found in Xanthidae, Portunidae, and Grapsinae. Type IV is only a few single secretory cells. Type IV is found in Varninae, and one species of Sesarminae, Chasmagnathus convexus. These tegumental glands are not found in other decapod larvae. The same type of the gland is often possessed by species belonging to the subfaimly, and it is suggested that the morphology of these tegumental glands reflects the phylogeny of the crabs.

AB  - In Bahia Samborombon (SW Atlantic; 35 degrees 39'-36 degrees 22'S; 56 degrees 45'-57 degrees 23'W) migratory American golden plover (Pluvialis dominica), black-billed plover (P. squatarola), ruddy turnstone (Arenaria interpres), and whimbrel (Numenius phaeopus) forage on fiddler crabs (Uca uruguayensis). These shorebirds have distinct patterns of feeding behavior and capture different proportions of each sex and size. I dominica made short runs, capturing mostly juvenile crabs, which are eaten whole. P. squatarola use a similar feeding strategy but capture females primarily. A. interpres walks continuously, capturing almost exclusively large male crabs (71%). N. phaeopus walk in the Uca patch and probe burrows by inserting the bill; they primarily capture females. The feeding rate of A. interpres is higher than that of P. dominica, I squatarola, and N. phaeopus Handling time shown by P. dominica and A. interpres was greater than the other two species for all categories of crabs. In all cases, handling time of male crabs was greater than those of either females or juveniles. All the evidences suggest that U. uruguayensis is an important food source for all these species and should be accounted in any conservation endeavor.

As they are easily found in river mouth areas, they can probably serve as good indicators for heavy metals pollution. The results show Pb and Cd concentrations were high whereas Zn and Cu concentrations were within the permissible limits.

AB  - One of the most remarkable examples of claw asymmetry in crustaceans is found in the sexually mature male fiddler crab (Decapoda, Ocypodidae, Genus: Uca). As any other arthropods, male fiddler crabs, in order to grow, must periodically shed the old exoskeleton to allow continued tissue growth. At ecdysis, the animal must pull out the large muscular mass of the chela through a narrow exit at the basiischial joint. It is hypothesized that this withdrawal is facilitated by a reduction in the chela muscle mass during proecdysis. In order to test this hypothesis, a study of claw muscle atrophy in male fiddler crabs was initiated. Since the diameters of the basiischial joint of each claw are similar, the hypothesis predicts that the closer muscle in the major claw should undergo a greater atrophy than that in the minor claw. The dimorphic claws contained two different types of slow muscle fibers. S$\sb1$ fibers accounted for about 90% of the fibers in the major claw closer muscle, while S$\sb2$ fibers comprised the remaining 10%, as well as the entire fiber population in the minor claw closer muscle. Myofibrils of S$\sb1$ fibers contained relatively long sarcomeres (about 6$\mu$m) with long A-bands (about 5$\mu$m); the cross-sectional area was 2.17 $\mu$m$\sp2$. In addition, the Z-discs between the adjacent myofibrils were not in register. S$\sb2$ fibers had shorter sarcomeres (about 4.5-5 $\mu$m) and A-bands (4-4.5 $\mu$m) and smaller cross-sectional areas (0.96 $\mu$m$\sp2$) and Z-discs that were in register. S$\sb2$ fibers contained greater numbers of well-developed mitochondria than S$\sb1$ fibers, suggesting that S$\sb2$ fibers are more fatigue-resistant. The degree of muscle atrophy was quantified by ultrastructural and biochemical analyses of muscle fibers from late proecdysial animals. Muscle atrophy was greater in the major claw than in the minor claw. Furthermore, muscle in the major claw of late proecdysial animals regenerating 8 walking legs showed a greater atrophy than those animals regenerating only one leg.

AB  - Molt-induced atrophy was examined in the closer muscles of the dimorphic claws of the fiddler crab, Uca pugnax. In adult males, the major claw, which is about 30 times larger than the minor claw, contains primarily S1 fibers and some S2 fibers, while the minor claw contains exclusively S2 fibers. Ultrastructurally, both S1 and S2 fibers resembled slow fibers of other crustacean species: high ratios of thin:thick myofilaments, thickened Z-lines, and myofibrils with long sarcomeres. However, the S1 fibers had higher thin:thick myofilament ratios (9:1 vs. 6:1), longer sarcomeres (6-mu-m vs. 4.5-5-mu-m) and fewer mitochondria than the S2 fibers. During proecdysis, the muscle of the major claw underwent a greater atrophy than that of the minor claw. Furthermore, atrophy of the major claw muscle was enhanced by the number of walking legs being regenerated. The weight of the major claw muscle in animals regenerating one walking leg decreased about 50%, while that in animals regenerating eight walking legs decreased about 67%. The weight of the minor claw muscle decreased about 25% in animals regenerating either one or eight walking legs. Changes in myofibrillar cross-sectional areas paralleled the reductions in muscle mass. In S1 fibers, cross-sectional area decreased 43% in animals regenerating one walking leg and 78% in animals regenerating eight walking legs. In S2 fibers, cross-sectional area decreased 27% and 32%, respectively. Increases in the thick myofilament packing density and decreases in the thin:thick myofilament and actin:myosin heavy chain ratios suggest that this atrophy involves a preferential hydrolysis of thin myofilaments. The ultrastructural changes in S2 fibers from major and minor claws were similar, suggesting that the preferential atrophy of the major claw muscle results, at least in part, from a differential sensitivity of S1 and S2 fibers to factor(s) that trigger protein degradation.

AB  - Study made on the survey of neurosecretory cells between the control and the experimental groups (5-HT, OCT and DOP administered) exhibits the presence of A, B and C type of cells in the brain and A, B, C, and D type of cells in the thoracic ganglia. Among these cells. only 5-HT, OCT, DOP and saline treated groups. Further the staining reaction of the neurosecretory cells of 5-HT treated crabs are comparatively intense than the other treated groups in view of more neurosecretory granules found in the respective neurosecretory cells.

AB  - The influence of different biogenic amines namely 5- hydroxytryptamine (5-MT, serotonin), octopamine (OCT) and dopamine (DOPA)was tested on ovarian and spermathecal development in a brackishwater crab, Uca (Celuca) lactea annulipes. Administration of 5-HT showed stimulation while octopamine and dopamine failed to exhibit any effect thus supporting the hypothesis that endogenous 5-HT has a stimulatory effect on the development of ovary and spermatheca in Uca (Celuca) lactea annulipes.

The brain is provided with three types of neurosecretory cells namely A, B and C and thoracic ganglion with four types of neurosecretory cells A, B, C and D. They vary in number and neurosecretory activity according to seasons which may be responsible for the increase in the size and development of the reproductive and associated structures.

AB  - Male body size was tested for its influence on female choice and male-male competition among fiddler crabs, Uca paradussumieri Butt, 1973. Both processes, that drive the evolution and maintenance of male traits and female preferences, had an influence on male body size. Females preferred larger males as mates. Copulation time was shorter in cases where females were larger than males. Compared with rejected males, accepted males had greater carapace breadth and length. Larger males were more successful in competition against smaller males, but body size had no effect on fighting duration.

AB  - The distribution, morphology, population density, and adult sex ratio of fiddler crabs in southern Thailand were studied. Nine (sub-)species of fiddler crab were found: Uca lactea annulipes (H. Milne Edwards, 1837). U. triangularis bengali Crane, 1975, U. forcipata (Adams & White, 1848), U. vocans hesperiae Crane, 1975, U. lactea perplexa (H. Milne Edwards, 1837), U. rosea (Tweedie, 1937), U. paradussumieri Bott, 1973, U. tetragonon (Herbst, 1790), and U. urvillei (H. Milne Edwards, 1852). Three forms occurred in both the Andaman Sea and the Gulf of Thailand: U. v. hesperiae, U. forcipata, and U. l. annulipes. The population densities of these three were higher in the Andaman Sea. In four species, more than 50% of the males were right-handed: U. tetragonon, U. t. bengali, U. v. hesperiae, and U. forcipata. More than 50% of the males in eight out of the nine species had brachychelous claws. Only U. tetragonon males had brachychelous and leptochelous claws in equal proportions. Six out of nine species in the Andaman Sea and two out of three species in the Gulf of Thailand had male-biased sex ratios.

AB  - The body size and residency status of male fiddler crabs, Uca vocans hesperiae, were examined as potential factors affecting fighting outcome. We observed 100 pairs of males naturally engaged in fighting behaviour and recorded fighting duration and the identity of the winners. Fighting pairs tend to be larger than average males in a population. Larger males tend to win fights regardless of residency status. Fighting duration was shorter when the size asymmetry between fighting pairs was greater. Residency status had no effect on fighting outcome.

AB  - We performed a field experiment to investigate the effect of carapace width, major cheliped length and burrow ownership on the fighting success of male fiddler crabs (Uca annulipes). We removed males from their burrows and released them back into the colony (n = 82). Released males tended to initiate encounters with burrow owners slightly smaller than themselves. Several general predictions of Sequential Assessment Game models of contest behaviour were supported: (1) residents won more encounters; (2) intruders were more likely to ruin when larger than residents. When body size (carapace width) was controlled for, intruders with relatively large claws for their body size were more likely to win contests; (3) the duration of encounters was related to the size difference between males; (4) encounters won by the larger male were of shorter duration than those won by the smaller male; (5) encounters won by the resident tended to be of shorter duration than those won by intruders (P = 0.07); (6) on average, encounter duration was longer when the intruder was larger than the resident. However, the encounters we documented began with seemingly costly behaviour such as pushing and the inter-locking of daws and did not unambiguously escalate from initial low cost behaviours. Sequential assessment of relative fighting ability may therefore not have been occurring. Prior visual assessment of opponents' fighting ability, followed by 'all-out fights' during physical encounters may also provide a plausible explanation for our results.

AB  - We investigated among-male variation in courtship waving in the fiddler crab Uca annulipes. Wave rate is positively correlated with both male carapace size and relative claw size (controlled for body size), and relative claw size is positively correlated with an index of body condition. An experimental reduction in the availability of food decreased male wave rate. These data suggest that some of the variation in wave rate among males is due to variation in male condition combined with energetic costs to waving (differential costs). However, we also found that the correlation between male size and wave rate decreased over the semilunar cycle. Later in the cycle, smaller males increase their wave rate relative to that of larger males. Previous work has shown that females are more likely to accept a smaller male as a mate later in the cycle. We suggest that smaller males invest disproportionately more in courtship later in the cycle because the potential benefits are greater due to their increased attractiveness to females (differential benefits). Alternative explanations for the observed temporal trend are also discussed.

AB  - Do predator-prey 'waiting games' where prey hide from potential predators have inherently unstable evolutionary outcomes, making it impossible to generate quantitative predictions about hiding times? Fiddler crabs, Uca lactea perplexa, respond to potential predators by retreating into their burrows. Time inside the burrow during unprovoked retreats during normal activity provides a 'null model' to test whether sex, tidal cycle and body size affect hiding time from potential predators. Using experimentally created predator-like stimuli we found that males hid for significantly longer than females, and larger crabs of both sexes also hid for longer. This differs from burrow use during unprovoked retreats, suggesting hiding time varies depending on the potential risk of predation on re-emergence. If risk prior to hiding predicts risk on emergence, the closer the proximity of a predator-like stimulus when first encountered the longer crabs should hide. We confirmed this experimentally (stimuli at 0.5 versus 2.5 m). Finally, we tested whether males hide for longer when a predator-like stimulus approaches them directly rather than tangentially. None of three pairwise comparisons was statistically significant, but crabs hid less as the angle of approach became more tangential. These results suggest prey can use stimuli prior to hiding to predict predation risk on re-emergence, but studies on predators are required to test this claim. Finally, theoretical models must explain why hiding time has a lognormal distribution and low variance such that a predator can predict when most prey will re-emerge. For example, 95% of crabs re-emerged within 2.3 min of hiding. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB  - We measured aerial and aquatic oxygen consumption values at typical diel extreme temperatures for Uca vocans, Uca tetragonon, and Uca crassipes from Hoga and the Kaledupa Islands in the Wakatobi National Park, Sulawesi, Indonesia. These fiddler crabs exhibit distinct intertidal distributions that may affect air and water oxygen extraction rates. Uca vocans and U. tetragonon occupy low intertidal zones that experience long submersion times, whereas U. crassipes inhabits high intertidal habitats having long emersion periods. Respective aerial oxygen consumption rates were 0.312, 0.300, and 0.193 mg/l at 26.0 degrees C, and 0.600, 0.554, and 0.357 mg/l at 32.1 degrees C. Aquatic oxygen consumption rates at 26.0 and 32.1 degrees C were 0.0041, 0.0065, and 0.0028 mg/l, and 0.0063, 0.0047, and 0.0050 mg/l, respectively. Temperature quotients (Q(10)) for all crabs were approximately 2 in air; however, U. vocans and U. tetragonon increased Q(10) to approximately 3 when moved to water, whereas U. crassipes Q(10) values remained essentially unchanged. High oxygen extraction rates and Q(10) responses in aerial environments may allow U. vocans and U. tetragonon to repay oxygen debt quickly during short emersion periods. Because U. crassipes spends most of its time emerged, it is less dependent on anaerobic respiration, and may not need to rapidly pay back oxygen debt.

AB  - Metabolic responses of sand fiddler crab, Uca pugilator, populations in northwest Florida are greatly influenced by seasonal temperature fluctuations. Crabs acclimated at 20 degrees C and immediately transferred to either 14 or 26 degrees C produced an acute metabolic response with respective temperature quotient (Q(10)) values of 3.46 and 3.91. Crabs acclimated at 10 and 20 degrees C exhibited a Q(10) of 2.62 indicating a partial compensation response. A brumation (reverse) response (Q(10) value of 20.11) was observed for acclimated crabs between 5 and 10 degrees C. Brumation is advantageous during winter when food supplies are scarce and crabs must survive extensive periods of inactivity. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Vertical and horizontal distributions are described for megalopae of 11 brachyuran taxa common to the lower Chesapeake Bay and adjacent shelf. Three distribution patterns are apparent from horizontal distributions. More than 75% of the megalopae of estuarine adults, such as Hexapanopeus angustifrons, Neopanope sayi, Panopeus herbstii, Rhithropanopeus harrisii and Pinnotheres ostreum are retained in estuarine waters. The megalopae of 3 estuarine taxa, Callinectes sapidus, Uca spp. and Pinnixa sp., are most abundant on the shelf. more than 90% of the magalopae of the shelf species, Portunus sp., Cancer irroratus and Libinia spp. remained in shelf waters. Vertical distributions indicate the megalopae of a majority of estuarine crabs are epibenthic when waters are stratified. Exceptions include the megalopae of both Rhithropanopeus which are found slightly shallower in well mixed waters and CAllinectes sapidus which are generally most abundant in the neuston. The megalopae of 2 shelf species, Portunus sp. and Cancer irroratus, reach highest densities in surface waters, while those of Libinia spp. are common in the epibenthos. Megalopal distributions analyzed with respect to water column stratification show megalopae never reached highest densities within the layer of the pycnocline. The megalopae of 5 spp. show significant shifts in vertical distribution between stratified and homogeneous water columns.

AB  - Herein I present a brief review of biased sex ratios in fiddler crabs and examine a limited data set involving a population of Uca pugilator (Bosc, 1802) to explore causes of such biases and highlight unresolved questions. Although male-biased sex ratios in Uca populations often have been recorded historically, such observations are generally disregarded as sampling error. However, a review of the fiddler crab literature followed by a meta-analysis of published sex ratio data indicated that this trend is significant and widespread, but the causes of male-biased sex ratios and whether they arise at birth or are acquired subsequently remain conjectural. I investigated the influence of sampling method, habitat use, and size class on the sex ratio of Atlantic sand fiddler crabs in a Georgia, U.S.A., salt marsh. Pitfall trapping and excavated-quadrat sampling were used to survey U. pugilator across foraging and burrowing habitats. Tethering experiments were conducted to evaluate the influence of differential predation on crab sex ratios. Finally, discarded chelae from salt flats were collected to estimate the size of male crabs consumed in nature. Sex ratio differed significantly among size classes, with the percentage of males increasing with increasing carapace width. Both sampling methods yielded male-biased sex ratios (Pearson chi-square, P < 0.001), but females predominated among juvenile crabs (5.0-10.0 mm CW). Females outnumbered males within burrows whereas males dominated in foraging areas (Pearson chi-square, P < 0.001). Predation on tethered crabs was low, ranging from 0 to 3.3% (N = 145) during 24-hr trials. Taken together, these results suggest that male-biased sex ratios in U. pugilator may be derived, owing to differential mortality between the sexes. However, the cause of elevated mortality in females could stem from increased energetic costs associated with reproduction and/or decreased predation on large male crabs resulting from their enlarged major chelae.

AB  - Feeding activity and prey selection of adult bay anchovies Anchoa mitchilli in the high-salinity North Inlet Estuary, South Carolina (USA), were examined during 2 summer days and nights in 1985. Stomach contents were compared to 2 size fractions of zooplankton (153 and 365 .mu.m mesh) collected at the same time (every 2 h) and place (near the bottom) in a tidal creek. Adult bay anchovies (40 to 60 mm) consumed a wide variety of zooplankton, but selected items according to prey size, density, and type. Most prey items were between about 0.4 and 3.25 mm in length, although some copepods (less than 0.3 mm) and decapod shrimps (up to about 12 mm) were eaten. Among the available potential prey taxa, crab (primarily Uca) megalopae were by far the most important. Uca megalopae comprised almost 60% of the diet based on numbers and volume and were favored even when their densities were much lower than other similar sized animals. First stage pinnotherid crabs and hydromedusae were completely avoided. There were distinct tidal and diel rhythms in feeding patterns and prey selection. Generally, large prey (e.g. Uca megalopae, shrimp zoeae, amphipods) dominated the diet around high tide especially at night, and small items (e.g. copepods, Uca zoeae, barnacle cyprids) were most important around daytime low tide when larger prey items were less abundant in the water column. Rapid changes in feeding were observed when preferred prey became available, especially around dusk. Adult anchovies fed throughout the night and immediately responded to the sudden availability of crustacean larvae originating from nocturnal hatching events. All evidence suggests that adult anchovies are selective particle feeders which probably rely on more than vision alone to determine prey suitability. As a widely distributed and abundant planktivore, A.

AB  - Crab megalopae were collected daily in a secondary estuary near the mouth of Delaware Bay during 4 annual settlement seasons (1989 to 1992). The sampling site consisted of a raft from which 4 replicate collectors were deployed vertically at the water column surface. Each replicate collector was constructed from a segment of 20 cm diameter PVC pipe. The pipe was covered with a removable sheath of loosely interwoven strands of polypropylene upon which the megalopae settled. We assumed that settlement on the collectors was proportional to settlement on natural substrata near the sampling site each day. The 3 families Ocypodidae (Uca spp.), Portunidae (Callinectes sapidus), and Xanthidae comprised the vast majority of the megalopae collected. Daily settlement events occurred in clusters. Auto-correlation analysis showed decorrelation times ranging from 2 to 3 d for C. sapidus and from 1 to 2 d for xanthids and Uca spp. These define the durations of typical settlement episodes for each taxon. Xanthids and Uca spp. began to settle in mid summer and continued into early autumn. Major settlement of C. sapidus never occurred until late August, and the intensity of settlement usually decreased by late October. Results of G-tests showed no effect of lunar phase on settlement events, regardless of year or taxon. Likewise, binomial goodness-of-fit tests showed no significant effect of the spring/neap cycle on settlement. However, the observed frequency of settlement events for C. sapidus was significantly greater than expected for southward wind events in all 4 yr, while there was no consistent association between winds and settlement of Uca spp. or xanthids. Of the 3 taxa studied, only C. sapidus relies on wind-driven processes for transport to settlement sites. Transport of C. sapidus megalopae back into the estuary requires the coincident occurrence of a southward, alongshore wind event and a nearby patch of megalopae.

AB  - Recent studies have shown that zoea larvae of brachyuran crabs often occur in patches that are formed at spawning and persist on time scales ranging from days to at least a week. In the present work we investigated the spatial distribution of the megalopal stage of 2 taxa of brachyurans (Callinectes sapidus and Uca spp.) in Delaware Bay on the east coast of North America (ca. 38.6&DEG; N, 75.2&DEG; W). We used a combination of high-frequency plankton sampling and data from a moored current meter to characterize the length scale of patches of megalopae at a single station in the mouth of the bay. The study consisted of 12 separate sampling periods during the late summers of 2001 and 2002. During each period, plankton were collected every 10 min over a single flood-tidal phase. Current-velocity data were collected simultaneously via an S-4 current meter moored at the station. Subsequent analysis demonstrated the transport of patches of megalopae past the station during five of the sampling periods. The radius of the patches was determined through autocorrelation analysis. The radii of patches of C. sapidus megalopae ranged from approximately 500-2,000 m, whereas the radii for Uca patches was typically smaller with values around 500 m. This patchy distribution has important consequences for transport and settlement of the megalopae in juvenile habitat.

AB  - Herring gulls Larus argentatus were observed to kleptoparasitize American black ducks Anas rubripes feeding on fiddler crabs Uca pugnax in coastal New Jersey. Although widespread in Laridae, kleptoparasitism has never been described between these two species. Over two winters of intensive 24-hour behavioral observations, this interaction was observed on two occasions during similar tidal conditions. Although this appears to be a rare interaction with limited energetic consequences, we note that quantifying these uncommon interspecific interactions is a benefit of thorough behavior observations, which may refine estimates of daily energy expenditure.

AB  - On the basis of a sampling program performed monthly, a total of 12,033 fiddler crabs, Uca uruguayensis, were collected at the southern end of the Samborombon Bay, Rio de la Plata estuary, Argentina, from February 1995 to March 1996. Density ranged from 133 to 207 ind/m(2) over the 13-mo study period. The overall proportion of male crabs was 0.62. For small crabs, sex ratio was 1: 1, but as crab size increased, sex ratio first became female biased and then male biased. Crabs carried eggs from mid-spring to late summer. Prevalence of the parasite Leidya distorta varied between 5.24% and 17.8% throughout the study. Infested male crabs greater than or equal to 10.5 mm carapace width, which represented only 5.9% of the crabs collected, housed 68.8% of the total parasites recovered. Cryptoniscus larvae were much more frequent among molting (soft) than intermolt (hard) crabs. The cryptonisci infesting intermolt (hard) crabs were aggregated; i.e,, they showed a contagious distribution. Females of L. distorta were actively breeding in spring and summer. In autumn, reproductive activity gradually decreased, and by winter, all the adult female parasites showed empty marsupia. The growth of immature parasites appears to stop in winter and resume in spring. The size of the adult marsupial female parasite was positively correlated with that of the host. Because only 1.1% of the mature female crabs carried marsupial parasites, it is unlikely that L. distorta plays a regulatory role in the reproductive potential of the host population.

AB  - Fiddler crabs have compound eyes that are structurally fairly well understood. However, there has been much debate regarding their spectral sensitivity and capacity to enable colour discrimination. We examined the visual pigments of two North-American species (Uca pugnax and U. pugilator), one species from the Indo-West Pacific (U. vomeris) and the only Eastern-Atlantic species (U. tangeri) of fiddler crabs using in situ microspectrophotometry of frozen sections of dark-adapted eyes. Only one spectral class of visual receptor was found in the larger (R1- 7) retinular cells of each species, with maximum absorption peaking between 508 nm and 530 nm (depending upon species). The R8 retinular cell, that might contain a short-wavelength sensitive photopigment and provide a basis for colour vision, was too small to analyze by these methods. Rhabdoms were lined with screening pigment which strongly influenced each species' spectral sensitivity, sharpening the peak and shifting the maximum towards longer wavelengths, on occasion to as far as the 600 nm region. We hypothesize that sensitivity to longer wavelengths enhances contrast between background (blue sky or tall vegetation) and the male major claw during the waving display.

AB  - We measured temporal and spatial components of the waving display in a Uca tangeri population to look for inter-individual differences in male waving structure that may convey information about individual identity. We found evidence that the spatial components of wave structure, especially "Maximum amplitude" are responsible for most of the between-male variation of the display. This variation could reflect differences in individuals' condition and/or could be used by conspecifics to discriminate amongst familiar and unfamiliar individuals.

AB  - One of the possible costs of the male fiddler crabs enlarged claw can be conspicuousness to predators. This hypothesis was tested using human observers as a model of visual predators. In the European fiddler crab, Uca tangeri Eydoux, the males' major claw is white contrasting with the orange-brownish colour of the carapace and of the feeding claw, and the mudflat background. The following morphotypes were created from close- up photographs taken in nature using an image processing software: male, male without claw, female, female with enlarged claw, male with enlarged claw of the same colour of the feeding claw, male with 75% sized claw, male with 50% sized claw. These morphotypes were then presented in a randomised order to students, using a psychology test software, which allows the measurement of response time in msec. The subjects were allowed to look at the images for an unlimited amount of time, until they detected the individual or until they decided to pass on to another image. Backgrounds (i.e. mudflat picture) without individuals were also presented as a control. Male crabs were detected significantly sooner than females. When we compared males with the claw removed with females with an enlarged claw added, the pattern is reversed and the latter are detected significantly faster. Thus, the enlarged claw seems to be the key feature that makes the individuals more conspicuous. Size and colour seem to be the main aspects of the claw's conspicuousness. The data of these experiments support the initial prediction of males being more conspicuous than females because of their enlarged claw. The possible costs and benefits of this trait, related to predation, are discussed.

AB  - The major claw of male fiddler crabs, reaching up to 40% of the individual's total body weight, may impose a cost on males when escaping from predators. To test this hypothesis, 38 males (18 without the major claw) and 19 females were randomly captured and placed, individually, in a straight track. After a five- minute adaptation period, an observer walked toward the crab and triggered its escape reaction. Each crab was subjected to 10 trials with 5-minute intervals between them. The central area of the track was video-recorded with a camera from a height of 1.30 m, pointing to the ground at a 90 degrees angle. Females ran significantly faster than males with claw, but the escape velocity of males without claw did not differ significantly from that of intact males or females, Speed was strongly correlated with air temperature. The distances at which males and females reacted to and hid from approaching humans did not differ. These results are discussed in an ecological and evolutionary perspective.

AB  - Excavation Counts (absolute density), burrow counts and surface active individuals visual counts in a Uca tangeri population were compared. Population density estimated from burrow counts was not significantly different front population density estimated by excavation, but the population density estimated with visual counts was significantly lower than the absolute density. Ovigerous females should he the main cause of these differences because they frequently remain underground, but other groups of crabs are also contributing to this difference. Burrow counting is an accurate and quick non-invasive method for the census of U. tangeri. Other population measures (e.g. sex ratio) are not obtainable by burrow counting and only further understanding of the activity patterns of this species along the tide cycle, moon phase and reproductive season will allow visual counting of surface active individuals to be used as quick, efficient and non-invasive method for crab density and population structure estimation.

AB  - The 'aggressive wandering' behaviour of male fiddler crabs is well documented in several species and is usually described as an apparently random movement through a population, punctuated by threats and combat directed at displaying males, and superficial burrow explorations. It has been suggested that wandering males are mainly low condition individuals with a regenerating major claw, unsuccessful at attracting mates, wandering through the population seeking surface copulations as an alternative to burrow copulations, which may be considered an alternative reproductive tactic. In order to test this hypothesis we have made several predictions. We observed several focal wandering males, compared sizes of wandering and resource holder individuals, and monitored their abundance across the lunar cycle. We did not observe any surface copulation attempts in any of our focal subjects. The number of burrows explored by wandering males was highly variable and not dependent on the subject's size although larger males do spend more time superficially exploring burrows. Wandering males are significantly larger than burrow-holder males and there was a peak in wandering in the first moon quarter. We conclude that it is important to dissociate wandering from surface copulations and that wandering is not an alternative reproductive tactic for lower condition mates. The number of wandering males across the lunar cycle still suggests that wandering may be related to mating and we discuss several ways in which it could be possible.

AB  - In an effort to explain the difference in potencies between the two characterized crustacean pigment-dispersing hormones (small alpha, Greek-PDH; small beta, Greek-PDH) and to define a role for residue 3 in these octadecapeptide hormones, we have synthesized and purified seven position 3 small alpha, Greek-PDH analogues ([Ala3], [Ile3], [Asn3], [Gln3], [Asp3], [Glu3], and [Lys3]small alpha, Greek-PDH). When tested for melanophore pigment-dispersing activity in destalked Image, [Glu3]small alpha, Greek-PDH was found to be 325% more potent than small alpha, Greek-PDH. Reduced potencies were observed for the [Asp3] (58%), [Asn3] (26%), [Gln3] (11%), and [Ala3] (8%) derivatives. Much lower potencies were displayed by the [Lys3] and [Ile3] analogues (0.73% and 0.66%, respectively). These results suggest that the position 3 side chain carboxylate anion of [Glu3]small alpha, Greek-PDH stabilizes the active receptor-bound conformer through a charge-charge interaction.

AB  - Very few studies have presented compelling evidence for adaptive shifts in female mating preferences. Additionally, there is almost no data on how males adjust courtship effort when female mating preferences change predictably. How should males respond? Should a currently more attractive male increase his courtship effort because he has, for now, a better chance of reproducing? Or should he maintain/lower his courtship effort and conserve energy because he already has an edge on the competition? We experimentally measured female mating preferences and male courtship effort (i.e., male mating preferences) in the fiddler crab Uca mjoebergi. Using robotic males, we documented a consistent shift in female preferences for male claw size across each of 6 biweekly mating periods: females tested at the beginning of a mating period preferred large males, whereas those tested at the end preferred small males. This is one of the fastest-known temporal changes in the mean mating preference of a population and supports our prediction of an adaptive response due to time constraints on larval development. Males adjusted their courtship effort across the mating period in concert with the observed daily shift in the mean female mating preference. Interestingly, changes in courtship effort depended on male size. We interpret this shift as males increasing their courtship effort to take advantage of their current attractiveness to females. To our knowledge, this is the first study of the interactions between shifts in female and male mating preferences.

AB  - White spot syndrome virus (WSSV) of the black tiger prawn Penaeus monodon is a recently discovered baculo-like virus disease which is currently the cause of very serious and widespread losses in the shrimp industry in Thailand and elsewhere in Asia. Three suspected crab carriers of this virus commonly found in shrimp-rearing areas were investigated. These were Sesarma sp., Scylla serrata and Uca pugilator. AR these crabs could be infected with WSSV by injection and they sustained heavy viral infections for up to 45 d (confirmed by normal histology, specific in situ DNA hybridization and PCR amplification) without visible signs of disease or mortality. All of them also transferred the disease to P. monodon via water while physically separated in aquarium cohabitation tests. Transfer of the virus to the shrimp was monitored using in situ DNA hybridization and PCR assay at 12 h intervals after cohabitation began. With U. pugilator, WSSV could be detected in the shrimp cohabitants after 24 h using PCR amplification and after 60 h using in situ hybridization. With S. serrata, the shrimp were positive for WSSV after 36 h using PCR and after 60 h using DNA in situ hybridization. With Sesarma sp. they were positive after 48 h using PCR and 72 h using in situ hybridization. These laboratory studies demonstrated that crab carriers of WSSV may pose a real threat to cultivated shrimp. However, the studies were carried out in containers with a small volume and with relatively clean sea water as compared to shrimp cultivation ponds. Pond-based studies are now needed to determine whether factors such as pond volume, pond water quality and shrimp and crab behavior can influence the rate and success of transfer.

AB  - Squid is a major marine resource in Japan both for raw material and for processed food. Fishery waste such as squid viscera could be used for various purposes including preparation of processed feeds and food supplements. However, the viscera of mollusks such as squid and yezo scallop are known to contain toxic heavy metals and high concentrations of cadmium accumulated in mollusks. Therefore, the application of squid viscera to food is extremely limited. It is necessary to establish effective methods for removing cadmium in order to utilize the viscera of mollusks. In this study, we screened salt-fermented food for bacteria with high salt resistance and cadmium-absorbing capability and examined their optimal conditions for cadmium-absorbing capability, in an attempt to establish a method for using them to remove cadmium from fermented fish sauce. In addition, laboratory-prepared fermented sauce made of squid gut was examined to determine the cadmium absorbing capability of the isolated bacteria. Four strains of bacteria with cadmium-absorbing capability were isolated from fermented foods made of fiddler crab and opossum shrimp. The cadmium-absorbing bacteria were identified as three strains of genus Staphylococcus and one strain of genus Halobacillus. These isolated strains could remove cadmium in a medium with salt concentrations of 0 to 20% at pH 5.0 to 7.0 and 35 degrees C. The cadmium-removal rate was 80 to 90% after 48 hours of incubation under optimal conditions. However, when laboratory-prepared fermented sauce samples made of squid gut were inoculated with these four strains of bacteria individually, the cadmium concentration was reduced to 30% after 48 hours of incubation under optimal conditions. Since these four bacteria were isolated from food sources and are able to grow in high salt media, they could be useful for reducing the cadmium in foodstuffs. It will be possible to further reduce cadmium concentration of fish sauce by combining this method using cadmium-absorbing bacteria.

AB  - The neurosecretory hyperglycemic hormone was purified from sinus glands of the shore crab C. maenas by a simple 2 step procedure which consisted of preparative acrylamide gel electrophoresis and subsequent gel filtrations on Sephadex G-50. A total of 280 .mu.g of pure hormone were obtained from 1065 lyophilized sinus glands (about 3.5 mg total protein). The hormone molecule contains 57 amino acid residues. A minimum MW of 6726 was calculated. The amino acid composition was (Pro, Bly, Ile, His, Trp)1; (Thr, Phe, Lys)2; (Met)3; (Ser, Ala, half-Cys, Val, Tyr, Agr)4; and (Glx, Leu)5; (Asx)9. The N-terminal amino acid residue was probably blocked. In Uca pugilator used as test animals, a hormone dose of 35 ng (about 5 pmol)/animal was sufficient to increase blood glucose level by 150%.

AB  - Hatching rhythms of intertidal crabs vary in timing with species, burrow position, tidal regimes and larval vulnerability. Most fiddler crabs time larval release with the nocturnal high fide. This is possible in semidiurnal tidal regimes because there are nocturnal high tides each lunar day. However, mixed tidal regimes have a semidiurnal and a diurnal period. During the diurnal phase high fide occurs in the afternoon. This variation in tidal inundation patterns may influence the timing of larval release. Comparisons between two populations of fiddler crab (Uca thayeri ), exposed to different tidal regimes, indicated they time larval release differently. The population exposed to semidiurnal tides timed larval release with the nocturnal high tide prior to the maximum amplitude tide. The population exposed to mixed tides timed larval release with the diurnal maximum amplitude tide. The differences between the populations can be related to their ecology but other variables may contribute.

AB  - We compared the timing of larval release by Uca thayeri exposed to different tidal regimes. Crabs on Florida's East Coast experience semidiurnal tides, whereas crabs on the Florida's West Coast experience mixed tides. In both populations, hatching occurred shortly after high tide. On the East Coast, most crabs released their larvae between dusk and midnight, a few days before the maximum amplitude spring tides. On the West Coast, most crabs released their larvae during the afternoon tropic tides of greater amplitude. West Coast crabs may release during the day because ebbing tides at night are too weak for effective transport. Thus, at each location, hatching occurs when phase relationships between the ebbing tides, the light- dark cycle, and tidal amplitude are most favorable. Further study is required to determine whether females on each Coast show fixed responses to each tidal regime, or whether they can alter their hatching rhythms upon exposure to different tides.

AB  - The acute toxicity of hexazinone, a herbicide intended for general noncropland areas and selected crop uses (alfalfa and sugarcane), was evaluated to establish proper handling guidlines and to measure its potential impact on the environment. The material is slightly to moderately toxic when given a single oral dose; its LD50 in male rats is 1690 mg/kg, in male guinea pigs 860 mg/kg and in male dogs > 3400 mg/kg, although, in the dog, emesis prevented accurate quantitation. When the material is adminisered i.p., the LD50 in rats is 530 mg/kg. Repeated doses (5 oral doses per wk for 2 wk) of 300 mg/kg to rats produced slight weight loss in 1 of 2 replicate experiments. In both studies, no gross or histologic alterations were apparent. Hexazinone is a moderate to severe eye irritant in the rabbit, and produced only mild erythema in rabbit skin at 5278 mg/kg, a dose which did not produce lethality or other clinical signs. Subchronic dermal exposures (10 consecutive doses) to rabbits produced increases in serum alkaline phosphatase and glutamic-pyruvic transaminase at the highest levels tested (680 and 770 mg/kg in 2 separate experiments), with no effects seen at 150 mg/kg. There were no alterations in livers from treated rabbits examined by light microscopy. No dermal sensitization was produced when concentrations of up to 50% were tested in guinea pigs. One-hour inhalation exposure of up to 7.48 mg/l did not produce mortality in rats. In freshwater biota, the material had slight to low toxicity, with 96-h LC50 [median lethal concentration] values being between 370-420 mg/l in bluegill sunfish, between 320-420 mg/l in rainbow trout and 274 mg/l in fathead minnnows. The 48-h LC50 in Daphnia magna was 152 ppm. In marine biota, similar low toxicity was indicated by a 48-h EC50 [median effective concentration] of 320-540 ppm in eastern oysters, a 96-h LC50 of 56-100 ppm in grass shrimp, and a 96-h LC50 > 1000 ppm in fiddler crabs. Bobwhite quail were not killed by feeding of up to 10,000 ppm. When given to quail as a single oral dose by intubation, the LD50 value was 2258 mg/kg. Ducks survived feeding of 10,000 ppm, indicating that the material has a low order of toxicity in water fowl and upland game birds. Hexazinone had a low order of acute toxicity when tested in mammals, freshwater and marine biota, and birds. The material is an eye irritant and should be handled carefully. Dermal irritancy, sensitization potential and systemic toxicity are low.

AB  - Many organisms time reproduction with physical and biological cycles that affect offspring survival. In the marine environment, a common pattern is the release of planktonic larvae during large-amplitude nocturnal tides, which may reduce losses due to predation. However, if the duration of embryonic development depends on temperature, changes in temperature can lead to errors in timing. Organisms may reduce such errors either by changing the timing of onset of incubation or by selecting the temperatures to which embryos are exposed. We conducted field and laboratory experiments with 2 species of fiddler crabs to examine the effects of temperature and temperature variation on the timing of larval release and synchrony of release among females. As expected, the duration of incubation increased with decreasing temperature in both species. In the field when temperature was low, Uca terpsichores released larvae earlier than expected, indicating that shifts in timing of mating reduced potential errors in timing of release. However, when temperature changed during incubation, accuracy and precision in the timing of release decreased. U. deichmanni maintained timing and synchrony of release despite variable temperature in the field, but in cold water in the laboratory, they incubated eggs longer than in the field and released larvae late. These differences suggest that U. deichmanni regulates the incubation period in the field. U. terpsichores may be less able than U. deichmanni to adjust to rapid variation in temperature that may accompany climate change, which could result in large-scale interspecific differences in larval survival and recruitment.

AB  - Behavioral toxicities of Cd and Ag were examined in the fiddler crab, Uca pugnax at 5ppt and 30ppt salinities. Changes in competitive foraging (scooping on mud surface and on a protein-rich patch) and dominance (ability to control patch and percent successful attacks) of both dominant and submissive crabs were examined prior to and after exposure of dominant crabs to series of μmolar concentrations of Cd and Ag. Results show that exposure of crabs to metal concentrations ≤22.3μM had no observable adverse effects on competitive behaviors. At 44.5μm Cd or Ag and greater, competitive behavior of the dominant crab was drastically diminished as compared with pre-exposure, while that of submissive crabs improved remarkably. The protective effect of salinity against metal toxicity was first observed at the lowest observable adverse effect level (LOAEL) of 44.5μM Cd or Ag. The ability of fiddler crabs to tolerate Cd to a greater extent than Ag (88.9-44.5μM) at 5ppt, but tolerance to a greater Ag concentration (148.0-88.9μM) at 30ppt suggests that Ag is more toxic than Cd at low salinity, but it is less toxic than Cd at high salinity. This shows that salinity plays an important role in determining metal toxicity, presumably, by altering metal speciation. The combined toxicity of Cd and Ag was examined by exposing dominant crabs to Cd and Ag in mixtures at the two salinities. At LOAEL, results suggest that the combined toxicity of Cd and Ag is additive at 5ppt, but may be synergistic at 30ppt. Analysis of tissue burden showed that the bioaccumulation of Cd and Ag increased on a whole body basis as well as in all subcellular fractions analyzed (i.e. organelles, enzymes, metallothioneins and insolubles) with the increase in metal exposure concentration. Unlike Cd, bioaccumulation of Ag was not affected by salinity. This may because neutral Ag chloro complexes are bioavailable whereas Cd chloro complexes are not. This study demonstrates that the toxicity of Cd and Ag is dependent on the physicochemical condition (e.g. speciation), and on metal ability to bind to intracellular fractions, specifically enzymes.

AB  - Behavioral changes in aquatic organisms such as reduced prey capture and decreased mobility have been linked to exposure to contaminants in the field. The purpose of this study was to compare competitive foraging and dominance behaviors of two populations of the fiddler crab, Uca pugnax, and to examine the relationship between tissue metal residues and observed differences in behavior. Foraging behavior (number of total scoops and scoops on a protein-rich patch) and dominance behavior (percentage of successful attacks) of fiddler crabs from an impacted site (Meredith Creek, New York) and a reference site (Tuckerton, New Jersey) were compared in the laboratory. Tuckerton (Tk) crabs were found to have twice the number of total scoops (70 vs. 38 scoops, p < 0.05) and three times the number of scoops on patch (34 vs. 10 scoops, p < 0.05) than Meredith (Me) crabs. No difference was observed between crab populations in the number of successful attacks (i.e., fights over the protein-rich patch). Analyses of total metal body burdens and metals associated with various subcellular fractions showed that, when compared with Tk crabs, Me crabs had higher levels of Ag, Cd, Cu, Ni, and Se in the heat-denatured proteins (HdeP) (i.e., enzymes). Metal bioaccumulation can have inhibitory effects on enzymes, which play an essential role in the regulation of various biochemical, metabolic, and physiological activities in crustaceans. This study suggests that there is a relationship between the accumulation of metals in HdeP (i.e., enzymes) and impairment of competitive foraging behavior in fiddler crabs. Additionally, this study shows that when compared with dominance behavior, foraging behavior is a more sensitive indicator of metal exposure and might be used as an end point in ecotoxicology studies.

AB  - Taura syndrome virus (TSV) was first reported as a serious cause of shrimp mortality limited to reared Penaeus (Litopenaeus) vannamei in the Americas, where it spread principally through regional and international transfer of live post larvae (PL) and broodstock. Subsequently, through importation of infected broodstock, TSV outbreaks spread to Asia, first to Taiwan and China and then to Thailand, Indonesia and Korea. Since its introduction to Thailand, outbreaks have occasionally been reported from rearing ponds stocked with batches of specific pathogen free (SPF) F vannamei PL that tested negative for TSV by nested RT-PCR assay. Since it was possible that the outbreaks may have occurred via horizontal transfer of TSV from wild carrier species, we tested 5 common native crustaceans that live in and around shrimp ponds (2 palaemonid shrimp species, Palaemon styliferus and Macrobrachium lanchesteri, and 3 species of crabs, Sesarma mederi, Scylla serrata and Uca vocans) for susceptibility to TSV in experimental challenges. We found that U. vocans, S. serrata and S. mederi did not die but, respectively, gave strong RT-PCR reactions indicating heavy viral load at 5, 10 and 15 d post-injection of TSV and 10, 15 and up to 50 d after feeding with TSV-infected P. vannamei carcasses. Also after feeding, P, styliferus did not die, but a high proportion gave strong RT-PCR reactions at 5 d post-challenge and no reactions at 15 d. Similarly after feeding, M. lanchesteri showed no mortality and gave only light RT-PCR reactions at 2 d, moderate reactions at 5 d and no reaction at 15 d. By contrast, transmission experiments from the TSV-infected crabs and palaemonid shrimp via water or feeding resulted in death of all the exposed P. vannamei from 8 to 12 d post-challenge and all were positive for heavy viral load by RT-PCR assay. Despite the results of these laboratory challenge tests, natural TSV infections were not detected by nested RT-PCR in samples of these species taken from the wild. These results indicated that transmission of TSV from infected crabs and palaemonid shrimp via water or feeding might pose a potential risk to shrimp aquaculture.

AB  - In order to study the potential role of the steroid molting hormone(20-hydroxyecdysone) in regulating molt-induced claw muscle atrophy, full-length cDNAs encoding retinoid-X receptor (G1-RXR) and E75 early ecdysone inducible g ne (G1-E75) were obtained from land crab ge (Gecarcinus lateralis) skeletal muscle mRNA using RT-PCR and 3' and 5' RACE. G1-E75A (3528 bp), which encoded a protein of 828 amino acids, had highest sequence identity to Me-E75A from a shrimp (Metapenaeus ensis). It was expressed in skeletal muscle and gonads. The deduced amino acid sequence of GI-RXR was highly similar to that of the fiddler crab RXR (Up-RXR) and insect ultraspiracle (USP). Nine variant sequences occurred in G1-RXR mRNAs at three alternative splicing sites, one in the "T box" in the linker D domain and two in the ligand-binding domain (LBD). The three T-box variants, termed T(+8), T(+7), and T(+12), contained insertions of 8, 7, or 12 amino acids, respectively. Four variants were generated at the first site in the LBD. Two of the LBD site I variants differed in the presence (+33) or absence (-33) of a 33-amino acid sequence; the other two were LBD truncations with or without the 33 amino acid sequence (+33 Delta E/F and -33AE/F, respectively). Two variants differing in the presence (+35) or absence (-35) of a 35-amino acid sequence were generated at the second site in the LBD. The G1-RXRa isoform (1516 bp) with the longest open reading frame (+12/+33/+35) encoded a protein of 436 amino acids. Thoracic muscle expressed only isoforms with the T(+12) sequence. In contrast, claw muscle expressed isoforms with T(+7) or T(+12) and fewer isoforms with T(+8). Ovary and testis expressed a greater number of RXR isoforms than skeletal muscle. All tissues expressed full-length and truncated RXR isoforms. These data suggest that differences in response of claw and thoracic muscles to elevated ecdysteroid are due in part to differences in the expression of RXR isoforms. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB  - Food hoarding is an adaptive strategy that enhances survival and reproductive success in food-scarce environments. It has been assumed that food hoarders, especially vertebrates, have the ability to cache food based on their current requirements and expected reproductive success. The present study provides empirical evidence that food storage in aquatic invertebrates is dependent on the availability of food and semilunar intertidal rhythms. The white-clawed fiddler crab Uca lactea, which inhabits food-scarce sandy mudflats, usually feeds on organic materials in sediment and occasionally on animal carrion, including conspecifics. This food is brought by the fiddler crabs into their burrows, presumably to be consumed during flood tides or heavy rains when the crabs cannot emerge to feed at the surface. When food was supplemented in the sediment every other day, females tended to store food-enriched sediment into their burrows. This behavior peaked around spring tides, when females were reproductively most active (i.e. mate-searching and mating). These results suggest that females may increase their reproductive effort by storing food.

AB  - Semilunar or lunar reproductive rhythms that follow tidal cycles are common in marine animals. For brachyuran crabs, an adaptive explanation for the synchronous release of larvae in phase with the tidal cycle is that females release larvae when their offspring are best able to escape predators. As a corollary to this hypothesis, the synchronous male reproductive cycle is selected to be in phase with female receptivity. As an alternative hypothesis, we propose that variation in food abundance influences the onset and intensity of the semilunar courtship cycle. We tested this hypothesis in male fiddler crabs (Uca lactea) by experimentally manipulating food availability for 4 weeks. Food-supplemented males built more semidomes and waved for more days than did food-deprived males or untreated control males. Moreover, food-supplemented males began courtship earlier and the median courtship day advanced with an increase in food. Courtship intensity was not related to crab size. These results provide the first evidence in marine animals that changes in food abundance due to the tides, and hence in phase with the semilunar cycle, influence male reproductive rhythm.

AB  - During the mating season, males of the fiddler crab Uca lactea build semidomes of mud at the entrances of their burrows to which they attract females for mating in the upper intertidal zone. Related species build similar structures which either reduce aggression between neighboring males or attract sexually receptive females. Male U. lactea did not build disproportionately more semidomes as density increased, suggesting that these structures do not modulate aggression. Larger males built higher and wider semidomes as would be expected if the semidomes are a courtship signal. When the high tides were too low to cover their habitat and the sediment dried, males were unable to build new or repair existing semidomes. Towards the end of the mating season more small males built semidomes perhaps because large males prevented them from courting earlier when most females mated. We made two experimental enclosures, added males to one and males and females to the other, and monitored semidome building. Males built significantly more semidomes in the enclosure with females. Overall, our observations support the hypothesis that the semidomes of U. lactea are a sexual signal.

AB  - Although the sensory trap model for sexually selected signals has been suggested over 2 decades, there has not yet been direct evidence how the sensory-trap response functions in the context of mate choice. In some species of fiddler crabs (genus Uca), courting males build ornamental structures at their burrows using mud or sand. There has been considerable suggestion that structures attract females because they elicit landmark orientation, a behavior that has evolved for predator escape not for mate choice. Here we tested if mate-searching female Uca beebei and U. terpsichores change their preference on structure building wavers depending on predation risk, by manipulating the predator visit frequency. We found that mate-searching females of both species more often oriented to the male building ornament when predation risk increased. Our finding suggests that, by orienting to the structures, females reduce their risk when searching for mates and then the relative attractiveness of males with structures should increase with an increase in the level of disturbance by predators. This study provided the first evidence that a female preference based on a sensory-trap response benefits the female when made in the mate-choice context.

AB  - Predation is generally thought to constrain sexual selection by female choice and limit the evolution of conspicuous sexual signals. Under high predation risk, females usually become less choosy, because they reduce their exposure to their predators by reducing the extent of their mate searching. However, predation need not weaken sexual selection if, under high predation risk, females exhibit stronger preferences for males that use conspicuous signals that help females avoid their predators. We tested this prediction in the fiddler crab Uca terpsichores by increasing females' perceived predation risk from crab-eating birds and measuring the attractiveness of a courtship signal that females use to find mates. The sexual signal is an arching mound of sand that males build at the openings of their burrows to which they attract females for mating. We found that the greater the risk, the more attractive were males with those structures. The benefits of mate preferences for sexual signals are usually thought to be linked to males' reproductive contributions to females or their young. Our study provides the first evidence that a female preference for a sexual signal can yield direct survival benefits by keeping females safe as they search for mates.

AB  - When females search for mates and their perceived risk of predation increases, they less often express preferences for males that use conspicuous courtship signals, relaxing sexual selection on production of these signals. Here, we report an apparent exception to this general pattern. Courting male fiddler crabs Uca beebei sometimes build pillars of mud at the openings to their burrows in which crabs mate. Females visit several males before they choose a mate by staying and breeding in their burrows, and they preferentially visit males with pillars. Previous studies suggested that this preference is based on a visual orientation behaviour that may reduce females' risk of predation while searching for a mate. We tested this idea by determining whether the female preference for males with pillars increases with perceived predation risk. We attracted avian predators to where crabs were courting and measured the rates that sexually receptive females visited courting males with and without mud pillars. Under elevated risk, females continued to search for mates and they showed a stronger relative preference for males with pillars. Thus, when predation risk is high, females may continue to express preferences that are under natural selection because they help females avoid predation, strengthening sexual selection for use of the preferred signal.

AB  - Males and females of most animals time reproduction and synchronize their reproductive activity to maximize lifetime fitness. When food is abundant, however, the 2 sexes may time investments in reproduction differently due to sexual differences in how energy limits reproductive success. Many intertidal animals have reproductive cycles with semilunar or lunar periods timed to coincide with a certain phase of the tidal amplitude cycle when offspring survive best. Given an optimal time to breed, well-fed females may increase their investment in offspring but not change when they breed, while males may invest more both before and after the mating peak. We explored this possibility by feeding a mixed-sex population of the fiddler crab Uca terpsichores in field enclosures over 2 sequential trials of 1 mo each. Food addition increased male courtship intensity, particularly in the latter part of the semilunar reproductive cycles, but did not change the peak days of reproductive activity. Food addition had no consistent effects on female mate-searching intensity or reproductive timing during either month-long trial. These results suggest that female reproductive cycles and their timing do not result from semilunar variation in food. However, since females breed at most once a month, the trials may not have been of sufficient duration to reveal an effect of food on female reproductive investment. Previous studies suggest that semilunar variation in predation on larvae is the most important factor regulating reproductive timing by both sexes. Our results indicate that additional food also influences the schedule of male reproductive investment.

AB  - Semilunar courtship rhythm is a widely distributed phenomenon among fiddler crabs in the genus Uca (Decapoda, Ocypodidae). Typically, synchronous courtship has been reported to peak near spring tides. To determine whether a region of large tidal variation shifts reproductive activity, we measured the frequency of specific courtship behaviors including claw-waving and semidome building for U. lactea males on Kanghwa Island, Korea. We found that synchronized courtship for U. lactea peaked near neap tides, whereas near the spring tides, seawater flooded the habitat and males predominantly fed on the mudflat. Although active females, which hold their burrows and usually feed on the mudflat, are abundant near to spring tides, males rarely claw-waved to attract females. This pattern is atypical for the species because other populations of U. lactea on Japan and Taiwan are synchronous around spring tides. We suggest that males invest most of their time in feeding during spring tides because foraging is limited during neap tides. During neap tides, males feed infrequently and thus expend stored energy on courtship signals. We conclude that patterns of reproductive synchrony may be dependent on food availability in periodically changing environments.

AB  - In some species of fiddler crabs, pair formation is composed of male claw waving, female attraction to semidome-like structures (e.g. hoods, semidomes, pillars), and underground mating. The sensory trap hypothesis, corroborated by arena experiments, suggests that the structures are used for searching females to avoid predators. In Uca lactea, such orientations by females to semidomes in the non-courtship context occur only in mating periods. During non-mating periods when males did not court females, females had no orientation bias between holes with and without semidomes. In the courtship context, females preferred males courting with semidomes. Thus our findings suggest that courtship structures in U. lactea might have evolved by female choice based on aesthetic preference. Our experiments also showed that males used the courtship structures as a landmark for homing while courting females. Furthermore, males with semidomes courted more freely than ones without semidomes by increasing the deviation between direction to the burrows and the lateral axis of the body. Therefore, the courtship structures might have originally evolved through pressures from predator avoidance in males.

AB  - Despite many reports of animals using visual landmarks for homing, surprisingly little is known about construction of landmarks for the purpose of orientation. Semiterrestrial crabs normally use a path integration method for short-range homing, but active courtship or territorial behavior may introduce errors increasing predation risk. We explored the hypothesis that male fiddler crab Uca lactea may build structures for landmark orientation to compensate for errors during courtship. Males without burrows found an artificial burrow with a semidome from a greater distance than one without a semidome. In addition, courting males retreated to the translocated semidome rather than to the original burrow location more frequently than noncourting males did. Finally, the maximum traveling distance from the burrow and the maximum deviation of the longitudinal body axis from the home vector were greater in males with semidomes than males without semidomes. Our results strongly support the hypothesis that male fiddler crabs build structures for landmark homing.

AB  - Fiddler crabs and many other intertidal animals have lunar or semilunar reproductive rhythms that follow the tidal amplitude cycles with these same periods. Female fiddler crabs typically release their larvae on days with large amplitude nocturnal tides which may reduce exposure of their vulnerable larvae to predation by diurnal planktivorous fish. Females mate about two weeks before their eggs hatch and males court most intensivly when most females are looking for mates. However, food availability and the time suitable for diurnal feeding also vary with the lunar cycle and the timing of reproduction by both sexes may reflect shared schedules of ingestion and allocation to reproduction. We explored this possibility by experimentally supplementing food to a mixed-sex population of fiddler crabs Uca terpsichores. The provision of additional food had no effect on the timing of sexual receptivity in females or in males but males courted more when they were better fed. This suggests that, female reproductive cycles are unaffected by natural cycles in food availability and that males expresses the same rhythm, presumably to maximize their opportunity to meet receptive females, but at an enhanced level when they are in better condition.

AB  - For males, courting and foraging are often behavioral alternatives, which take time and consume energy. When males have a possibility of mating with receptive females, there may be a behavioral trade-off between courtship and feeding; the outcome of which may be affected by male physiological condition and food availability. Although many mathematical models and empirical studies suggest that the expression of male courtship signals are condition-dependent, decisions about courtship and mating strategies in relation to food availability have not attracted much attention. In this study, we tested whether daily changes in food availability affect males' decisions about whether to court. We conducted experiments with the fiddler crab Uca lactea by providing males with additional food every other day. In food-supplemented enclosures, males did not increase courtship activity on the days when food was supplemented. However, they built more courtship structures (semidomes) and waved more on the days when they were not given additional food. Male size had a strong influence on the number of days the males courted. We also tested whether the frequency of surface mating, as an alternative reproductive tactic, decreased when food was supplemented. Contrary to our expectation, the number of males that exhibited the surface-mating tactic increased when food was supplemented whereas the number of mate-searching females did not change. Our findings in this field study suggest that reproductive decisions by male fiddler crabs are affected by fluctuating food availability and present body condition, and the alternative mating tactic of this species may be more frequently used by males under good condition.

AB  - Microsatellite markers were developed for the fiddler crab Uca mjoebergi for use in paternity assignment. Five highly variable loci were found to amplify reliably in U. mjoebergi, although one locus exhibited evidence for the presence of null alleles, and two loci exhibited evidence of linkage. The number of alleles, expected heterozygosity and probability of paternity exclusion (P > 0.999) suggest that these markers when combined provide sufficient power to determine paternity by exclusion in this species. Three primer pairs were found to also amplify PCR products from three additional fiddler crab species (U. dampieri, U. flammula and U. seismella), and will prove useful for phylogeography and behavioural ecology of fiddler crabs.

AB  - Among crabs of the family Ocypodidae, Ilyoplax has been known to exhibit unique mud-using territorial behavior against neighbors, including neighbor burrow plugging, barricade building, and fence building. To assess the evolution of current behavioral forms observed in Ilyoplax, 1,416-bp nucleotide sequences from the mitochondrial 12S rRNA to 16S rRNA genes of 20 species, representing four recognized subfamilies of Ocypodidae, were analyzed. The resultant phylogenetic tree revealed the subfamily Dotillinae, including Ilyoplax, to be monophyletic, with a sister group relationship with subfamily Camptnadriinae. These two subfamilies were branched after Ocypodinae, with Macrophthalminae being most basal. Species of Ilyoplax fell into three different Dotillinae lineages, indicating the genus to be polyphyletic. Crabs in two of the three lineages showed differential geographic distribution and body size. Phylogenetic analyses of behavioral characters demonstrated that mud-using techniques had evolved multiple times and sequentially. From their behavioral similarity and evolutionary occurrence, fence building is hypothesized to have evolved from barricade building, and the latter, from burrow plugging. This scenario also appeared reasonable with respect to behavioral trends observed in the field. The evolution of such territorial behavior is considered to be associated with ecological conditions such as burrow fidelity and substrate condition.

AB  - We tried to unravel the possible links between the skewed predation risk in Uca tangeri (where large individuals are more at risk from avian predators) and size-dependent changes in the physiology and habitat choice of this fiddler crab species. Over a transect running from low to high in the tidal zone of a beach in Mauritania, the temperature profile at various depths in the substrate, the water-table level of seep water, salt concentration of seep water, depth of the aerobic level, operative temperatures on the surface, and size distribution of crabs were assessed. In addition, resting metabolic rates, Q10 and thermal and starvation tolerances were estimated. Going from low to high in the tidal zone, crab size and burrow depth increased. At the preferred burrowing depth, microclimatological conditions appeared to be equally favourable at all sites. At the surface, conditions were more favourable low in the tidal zone, where also food availability is sufficient to enable small crabs to forage in the vicinity of their burrows. Large crabs have higher energy requirements and are thereby forced to forage in flocks low in the tidal zone where food is probably more abundant. Low in the tidal zone, digging deeply is impossible as the aerobic layer is rather thin. Large crabs prefer living high in the tidal zone as (1) deep burrows ensure better protection against predators, (2) more time is available for digging holes and (3) the substrate is better suited for reproduction. Energy reserves in late summer ensured an average of 34 days of survival. It is argued that the allotment of energy to growth must be considerable even in reproducing animals; the rewards of growth being the disproportional increase in reproductive output with size.

AB  - The cDNA encoding the precursor of the pigment dispersing hormone (PDH) of the shore crab, Carcinus maenas, was isolated and sequenced. The precursor consists of a putative 22 amino acid signal peptide, a putative 33 residue peptide of unknown function, and the 18 amino acid mature PDH, followed by a Gly residue which serves as a possible amide donor. The deduced mature PDH amino acid sequence is identical to those of Uca pugilator and Cancer magister, previously determined by Edman degradation.

AB  - A new separation procedure yields about 60% recovery of light-adapting distal retinal pigment hormone (DRPH), contrasted with 0.4% for an earlier procedure. Aqueous extracts of Pandalus eyestalks are brought to pH 3.0 with acetic acid, and the supernate is chromatographed on G-25 Sephadex with 0.1 M acetic acid. DRPH is found in the first of seven designated peaks. When tested on the dispersed erythrophores of eyestalkless Palaemonetes vulgaris, Peak I shows no erythrophore-concentrating hormone (ECH). ECH activity occurs in Peak IV, which in turn has no significant DRPH activity; the two hormones thus appear to be different molecules. Paper chromatography of Peak IV reveals two or three ninhydrin-staining spots.

The hormone MDH, dispersor of melanophore pigment in destalked Uca pugilator, occurs in Peak I. The two chromatophorotropins thus appear to be distinct molecular species. Paper chromatography of Peak I shows a single spot (ninhydrin) which remains at the origin. Both paper electrophoresis and preliminary examination in the analytical ultracentrifuge, however, indicate the possibility of two components in Peak I and hence no statement can yet be made about the molecular identity of MDH and DRPH.

AB  - The application of separation procedures, including liquid partition, gel filtration, ion-exchange chromatography, partition chromatography, and reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography, enabled the purification of an octadecapeptide pigment-dispersing hormone (PDH) from powdered lyophilized eyestalks of the crab, Cancer magister. Automated Edman degradation, followed by the identification of carboxyl-terminal amide, established the sequence of the peptide as: Asn-Ser-Glu-Leu-Ile-Asn-Ser-Ile-Leu-GLy-Leu-Pro-Lys-Val-Met-Asn-Asp-Ala -NH2. The characterized Cancer PDH is structurally identical to an octadecapeptide PDH of Uca pugilator, but differs from the PDH of Pandalus borealis at positions 3, 4, 11, 13, 16, and 17.

AB  - Recent food habit and productivity research on the killifish, F. heteroclitus (L.), suggests that this species is important in the movement of organic material within and out of the salt marsh ecosystem. The stable C isotope ratios of Fundulus muscle tissue and gut contents were measured seasonally to determine the C sources of the killifish. Muscle .delta.13C values ranged -13.9.permill. to -15.8.permill. and -15.8.permill. to -18.4.permill. for gut contents, suggesting differential assimilation of ingested material. Assimilated C probably originated from a mixture of benthic algae and Spartina ingested by major prey species: the fiddler crab, Uca pugnax (Smith); the polychaete, Nereis (Neanthes) succinea Frey and Leuckart; the tanaid, Leptochelia rapax Harger; and other small crustaceans. Small fish (age 0-1 yr) showed slightly lower .delta.13C values than larger fish (age 1-3 yr), consistent with differences in their feeding habits. The only seasonal pattern was an enrichment in tissue 13C that occurred for both small and large fish in the spring, corresponding to the peak spawning period. The .delta.13C determination is a useful tool in identifying and tracing C sources through the salt marsh food web, detecting differences in feeding habits between age classes of organisms, and assessing the relative nutritive value of ingested dietary items if differential assimilation is suspected.

AB  - Many fossil animals bear traits such as crests or horns that probably functioned as sexually selected signals or weapons. Interpretations of these structures as functioning in mate choice or intrasexual contests are often controversial, with interpretations based on biomechanics or physiology being favoured by many. Although testing hypotheses based on sexual selection can be difficult, especially given that there is no single, reliable means of recognising sexual selection, we argue that it is not impossible; indeed, there are now several cases where sexual selection is strongly supported. In other cases, a careful study of features such as sexual dimorphism, ontogeny, and allometry, coupled with testing of alternative hypotheses, will be necessary to distinguish between possible explanations for exaggerated features.

AB  - We examined the recovery of vegetation and salt marsh macrofauna in a pipeline construction corridor at two locations where it intersected intertidal salt marshes near Charleston, SC. The impacts of construction were evaluated prior to construction and for subsequent periods of 34 and 46 months at the two sites using aerial photography and three field sampling methods. Quadrats were used to estimate densities of selected salt marsh invertebrates, as well as stem densities and aboveground wet-weight biomass of Spartina alterniflora; pit traps were employed to simulate natural tidal pools for sampling small, motile epibenthic macrofauna that remained on the marsh surface at low tide; and flume nets were used to sample the natant macrofauna that used the marsh edge at high tide. The analyses of vegetation by quadrat and aerial imagery clearly showed that the recovery of Spartina was more rapid and complete at the Ashley River site (88%) than at Wappoo Creek (48%). In contrast to this apparent, if partial, vegetative recovery, several salt marsh invertebrates, including Littorina irrorata and Geukensia demissa, were eliminated from the corridor during construction and showed scant recovery by the end of our study. Differences in species composition and abundance of natant organisms in the flume net collections also supported the conclusion that faunal recovery was incomplete after 3-4 years at these sites. The recovery of functional equivalency of the excavations, compared with natural marshes, was not evaluated during our study, but we speculate that their functioning may equilibrate over time, since preexisting hydrologic conditions are more or less intact, seedstock for Spartina revegetation is nearby, and macrofauna will probably eventually reestablish themselves from adjacent areas.

AB  - We investigated the behavior and physiology of sand fiddler crabs, Uca pugilator, during acute exposures to dilute artificial seawater (ASW). We measured the time crabs spent submerged in water or on wet sand when given the choice between sand and 100% ASW or sand and 10% ASW. Observations were made each hour during 6 hours of exposure. Crabs exposed to 10% ASW spent less time in the water throughout the entire trial. At 6 hours, crabs in 100% ASW were in the water about half the time (42.2 +/- 10.2 %), crabs in 10% ASW were in the water only a small portion of the time (4.4 +/- 2.6 %). We measured hemolymph osmolality in completely submerged crabs and in crabs allowed free movement between seawater and sand. After 6 hours, crabs allowed to move freely between 10% ASW and sand showed a smaller decrease in hemolymph osmolality (81.0 +/- 9.3 mOsm/kg) compared to crabs completely submerged in 10% ASW (150.1 +/- 27.6 mOsm/kg). To investigate physiological mechanisms, we estimated ion transport rates in crabs exposed to 20% and 100% ASW, using rubidium (Rb) as a tracer for potassium (K). Rb uptake was measured in a 20-minute assay in 20% ASW with the K replaced with 2 mM Rb. After 3 hours exposure to 100% or 20% ASW, Rb uptake rates were higher in crabs exposed to 100% ASW than in crabs exposed to 20% ASW. At 72 hours of exposure, crabs in 20% ASW had higher Rb uptake rates than crabs in 100% ASW. These results are consistent with acute physiological and behavioral responses during exposure to dilute seawater that differ from the chronic response.

AB  - Epibenthic community structure, somatic production and energy flow were studied in the Caete mangrove estuary in North Brazil on for 3 representative strata: high intertidal forest (F), small creeks in the forest (SC) and open mudbanks of large intertidal creeks (LC). Seven decapod crustaceans and I gastropod accounted for > 95 % of total epifaunal biomass, with highest values in the forest followed by large and small creeks (228.2, 103.6 and 69.7 kJ m(-2) respectively). The leaf- consuming crab Ucides cordatus was clearly dominant in the forest, followed by the fiddler crabs Uca rapax and U. vocator. The large creek stratum was strongly dominated by the fiddler crab U. maracoani, while in the small creek 4 species (Uca cumulanta, U. maracoani, Pachygrapsus gracilis and Eurytium limosum) contributed similar quantities to total biomass. Per area somatic production (P) and respiration (R) was highest in the large creek, followed by the forest and small creek stratum. Based on the contribution of each stratum, total biomass (332.8 kJ m(-2)), production (455.8 kJ m(-2) yr(-1)) and assimilation (2959.6 kJ m(-2) yr-1) were estimated for the whole area. While the herbivorous feeding guild with U. cordatus was the most prominent in terms of biomass (75 % of the total), the detritivorous fiddler crabs and P. gracilis clearly dominated in terms of respiration and somatic production (60 and 90 % respectively). Carnivores (Eurytium limosum and Thais coronata) contributed < 2 % to the epibenthic energy budget. A system picture emerges whereby energy flow is strongly dominated by herbivorous and detritivorous species, Both guilds probably promote mangrove primary production by (1) conserving nutrients in the system, (2) enhancing nutrient remineralization, and (3) oxygenizing the soil through their burrowing and feeding activities. A resulting positive feedback loop between mangroves, crabs and bacteria could explain the very high mangrove productivity and the high efficiency with which mangrove primary production is assimilated by the crabs (almost 15 %).

AB  - Abundance, biomass, population structure, growth, mortality and reproduction of 4 fiddler crabs (Uca cumulanta, U. maracoani, U. rapax and U. vocator) were studied in the Caete mangrove estuary, North Brazil, to understand their life history strategies and species distribution in the mangrove forest. Three zones were sampled in the mangrove ecosystem: high intertidal forest (F), small creeks running through the forest (SC), and open mud banks of large tidal creeks (LC). Significant differences between zones were found in silt/clay, water and organic content of the sediment. Species zonation was pronounced: U. rapax and U. vocator were restricted to the high intertidal forest (differing preferences for organic and water content of the sediment probably allows these 2 species to coexist); U. cumulanta and U. maracoani were mostly restricted to the mid and low intertidal (the sunny mud banks of large creeks were completely dominated by the latter, probably due to its greater tolerance to high temperatures). Fiddler crab biomass was highest in LC, followed by F and SC (72.9, 19.5, and 10 g m(-2), respectively), while abundance was highest in LC, followed by SC and F (79.1, 69.2, and 59.3 ind. m(-2), respectively). Population structure of all species was strongly skewed towards the smallest size classes, and sex ratios were 1:1 in U. maracoani and U. vocator, with significantly more females in U. cumulanta and U. rapax. All fiddler crabs studied were fast-growing, and had short life spans and high mortality rates. Von Bertalanffy growth parameters, growth performance, and total mortality rates were calculated for all species. L-infinity K, and Munro's phi' ranged from 11.1 mm carapace width (CW), 4.24 and 1.7 yr(-1) in U. cumulanta females up to 35.2 mm CW, 2.03 and 3.2 yr(-1) in U. maracoani males. Total mortality rates (Z) varied between 4.9 and 10.1 yr(-1), with females having generally 15 to 20% higher mortality rates than males, except for U. cumulanta. All species except U. vocator reproduced mainly during the dry season, but breeding was always prolonged and sometimes year-round, e.g. in U. rapax, 1 of the 2 species occurring in the forest. The second forest species, U. vocator, had a clear spawning peak towards the end of the rainy season and temporal separation of reproduction may also promote coexistence of the 2 species.

AB  - Great-tailed grackles, Quiscalus mexicanus, prey on fiddler crabs, Uca beebei, either by running straight at them or by running past them then angling sharply back to strike. Grackles that used angled runs caught only males and were twice as successful as birds that used straight runs and caught equal numbers of males and females. Why do grackles that use angled runs catch only males? Males were not differentially available, nor did grackles prefer them to females in choice tests. Fewer crabs entered their burrows when we moved a model predator past them than when we moved it directly towards them and crabs allowed the model to get closer when it passed then returned to strike. Although crabs may take more risks when birds use angled runs, the sexes did not differ in their escape responses. Hence, differential risk taking cannot explain male- biased predation by birds using angled runs. We suggest that males, with their large claws and lighter colours, are more conspicuous than cryptic females. When a bird runs past then turns to dash back at a crab it may be able to keep track of a male much better than a female. Indeed, grackles missed all females they struck at using angled runs. Hence, males may be conspicuous and preferred prey to birds using angled runs. Males' enlarged claws, bright colours and other sexually selected traits may increase male predation rate in this context. (C) 2001 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB  - The fiddler crab, Uca beebei, lives in individually defended burrows, in mixed-sex colonies on intertidal mud flats. Avian predation is common, especially of crabs unable to escape into burrows. Mating pairs form in two ways. Females either mate on the surface at their burrow entrance ('surface mating') or leave their own burrow and sequentially enter and leave ('sample') courting males' burrows, before staying in one to mate underground ('burrow mating'). We tested whether perceived predation risk affects the relative frequency of these mating modes. We first observed mating under natural levels of predation during one biweekly, semi-lunar cycle. We then experimentally increased the perceived predation risk by attracting grackles (Quiscalus mexicanus) to each half of the study site in two successive biweekly cycles. In each experimental cycle, crabs were significantly less likely to mate on the side with more birds. Moreover, on the side with elevated predation risk, the number of females leaving burrows to sample was greatly reduced relative to the number of females that surface-mated. Males waved less and built fewer mud pillars, which attract females, when birds were present. We discuss several plausible proximate explanations for these results and the effect of changes in predation regime on sexual selection.

AB  - Brood size and other life-history traits of females affect male investment in mating. Female Uca tetragonon, producing relatively small broods, were attracted to the burrows of males for underground mating (UM) while carrying eggs, Most UM females released larvae and ovulated new broods during the pairing, averaging 3.9 days. While a female was incubating one brood, another brood was developing within the ovaries because the females were feeding adequately during incubation. These findings suggest that in U. tetragonon, a small-brood species, females increase the total number of broods produced by breeding continually. In contrast, in large-brood species, feeding by ovigerous females is relatively brief and not enough to prepare the next brood during incubation, inducing temporal separation between incubation and brood production. Unlike females in other ocypodids where females with large broods remain in thr breeding burrows of males, most female U. tetragonon left the male after UM. Wandering in female U. tetragonon after the pairs separate may occur because their small broods are adequately protected by an abdominal flap. Relative brood size probably determines the vulnerability of the incubated broods to the females' surface behavior. Hence, male reproductive success in large-brood species may decrease greatly if males expel their mates after ovulation, although this is not necessarily so in small-brood species. Whether the male drives away the female or not may depend on which behavior within tither small- or large-brood species yields the greater male reproductive success. In U. tetragonon some females extruded eggs in their own burrows after surface mating as well as in males' burrows after UM. It was unclear whether females chose a male with a larger burrow as an UR I mate unlike several large-brood species. Burrows of both UM males and ovigerous females in U. tetragonon were relatively smaller than those in some large-brood species, indicating that incubation of small broods does not require large burrows. Rather than benefits of UM by female choice, wandering resulting from intersexual conflict, and sperm competition may explain why some females mate in males' burrows in this small-brood species.

AB  - We investigated inter-male competition for female mates and intersexual interactions in underground mating (UM) of the fiddler crab Uca paradussumieri. Males search for and then enter the burrows of females that are ready to ovulate ('pre- ovigerous'). In order to ensure their paternity, these males guard the female until she ovulates the following day. Thereafter the male leaves. Intruding male conspecifics attempt to reach the female. Guarding males either fight with them (N = 27), or use the flat-claw defence (N = 96) in which the male stands in the burrow shaft and blocks the entrance with his enlarged claw. The flat-claw was a very successful defence tactic (93% success), even when the intruder was larger than the guarding male. Pre-ovigerous females accepted the first male to enter her burrow, suggesting that female mate choice does not occur. Though males that succeeded to enter the burrow of pre-ovigerous female were larger than males that failed to do so, males that succeeded UM were not larger than males that failed UM. Males that succeeded UM by a take-over were not larger than either the males that were defeated or the males that succeeded in UM after their first entering. Early localization of pre-ovigerous females was important in male mating success, as was a male's ability to defend the female before she ovulated. However, some females that were not pre- ovigerous were guarded forcibly for 2 days by males that had failed to pair with a pre-ovigerous female that day. Prolonged guarding was less successful for males than guarding for one day, probably because the males had to fight with more intruders. Ln addition, prolonged guarding may not be adaptive for females because they lose feeding time and mate with males that lack competitive abilities.

AB  - We have investigated the impact of shrimp farming waste on benthic invertebrates in a mangrove estuary in southern Thailand. Stable carbon and nitrogen isotope analyses were used to assess the contribution of aquaculture feed as a nutrient source for benthic invertebrates (fiddler crabs Uca annulipes, U. bengali, and U. forcipata) and to compare the organic origin of sediments in tributaries with and without a shrimp farm. The isotopic contributions of shrimp feed to crabs varied between the tributaries: in the tributary with the farm, the crabs had higher contributions from shrimp feed, whereas there was only a small contribution from aquaculture feed in crabs from the reference tributary. In contrast, the contribution of shrimp feed to the sediment did not differ between the tributaries, the contributions to sediments from aquaculture feed were, in general, quite low. Based on these results, we suggest that, in mangrove estuaries, changes in the food sources of several surface feeder invertebrates would be an effective indicator of the possibility that aquaculture waste was affecting the benthic ecosystem.

AB  - Clarification of the role of mangrove root structures as shelter from predators for benthic animals was investigated by considering (1) the impact of predation on benthic faunal communities in a mangrove forest as indicated by a predator exclusion experiment, and (2) the uses and effects of mangrove root structures by benthic animals under laboratory conditions. In the exclusion experiment, three treatments (predator exclusion cages, partial cages and un-caged controls) were established on surface substrates in each of 3 microhabitats (tidal creek, mangrove cover present and mangrove cover absent) in a Rhizophora mangrove forest in Southern Thailand. After 1 month, benthic invertebrates were sampled and comparisons made of their species' richness, abundance and biomass among the treatments. Laboratory experiments were undertaken in tanks containing artificial mangrove roots, using 2 dominant crab species (Perisesarma indiarum and Uca bengali) as prey and the barred mudskipper Periophthalmus argentilineatus as predator. Crab preference for root structure and predation rates were recorded. Predator exclusion from the mangrove area resulted in enhanced species' richness, abundance and biomass of benthic invertebrates in all microhabitats, including those with mangrove roots. However, the partial cage treatment did not change such characteristics, indicating that the artificial cage itself did not affect the animals. The laboratory experiments demonstrated that crab preferences for root structures were not influenced by predator presence, and that root structures did not reduce crab predation rates. Such process of dominant species might be cause for significant predation in field benthic community. The overall results indicated that predation was significant for species' richness, abundance and biomass of benthic mangrove forest communities, and vertical root structures did not necessarily provide effective shelter for benthic animals.

AB  - Muni is a closed lagoon that opens to the sea when the water level is high, especially during the rainy season. During the dry period, the water level is very low and the salinity of the lagoon water increases sometimes exceeding that of seawater. Only three finfish species and 8 shellfish species (live animals and empty shells) were found in the lagoon and surrounding wetlands during the study which was conducted in March-June 1994. The blackchin tilapia Sarotherodon melanotheron (Cichlidae) is the dominant species. The castnet is the most important fishing gear used in the lagoon followed by various finfish and shellfish traps. The fishing effort in the lagoon is high and, like catch rates, it was found to be inversely related to the volume of water in the lagoon and the fishing situation in the sea. The estimated exploitation level (E = 0.65) indicates that S. melanotheron in the Muni lagoon could be considered as over-exploited. From the gonadosomatic index, S. melanotheron appears to spawn continuously in the Muni lagoon between the months of March and June. The von Bertalanffy growth parameters were estimated for S. melanotheron as Linfin = 12.5 cm standard length (SL), K = 0.70 yr-1 and t0 = 0.01 yr. The longevity of the fish is estimated as ca. 4.2 yr. Taboos and cultural practices contribute to the management and conservation of fisheries in the lagoon. However, additional formal management is required to ensure sustainability of the fisheries in the lagoon. In addition, there is a need to manage the lagoons physical and chemical environment including planting of mangroves around the lagoon in order to restore its mangrove cover. The poverty problem in the fishing community needs to be addressed to divert labour from the lagoon.

AB  - Irrigation by benthic macrofauna has a major influence on the biogeochemistry and microbial community structure of sediments. Existing quantitative models of bioirrigation rely primarily on chemical, rather than ecological, information and the depth- dependence of bioirrigation intensity is either imposed or constrained through a data fitting procedure. In this study, stochastic simulations of 3D burrow networks are used to calculate mean densities, volumes and wall surface areas of burrows, as well as their variabilities, as a function of sediment depth. Burrow networks of the following model organisms are considered: the polychaete worms Nereis diversicolor and Schizocardium sp., the shrimp Callianassa subterranea, the echiuran worm Maxmuelleria lankesteri, the fiddler crabs Uca minax, U. pugnax and U. pugilator, and the mud crabs Sesarma reticulatum and Eurytium limosum. Consortia of these model organisms are then used to predict burrow networks in a shallow water carbonate sediment at Dry Tortugas, FL, and in two intertidal saltmarsh sites at Sapelo Island, GA. Solute-specific nonlocal bioirrigation coefficients are calculated from the depth-dependent burrow surface areas and the radial diffusive length scale around the burrows. Bioirrigation coefficients for sulfate obtained from network simulations, with the diffusive length scales constrained by sulfate reduction rate profiles, agree with independent estimates of bioirrigation coefficients based on pore water chemistry. Bioirrigation coefficients for O-2 derived from the stochastic model, with the diffusion length scales constrained by O-2 microprofiles measured at the sediment/water interface, are larger than irrigation coefficients based on vertical pore water chemical profiles. This reflects, in part, the rapid attenuation with depth of the O-2 concentration within the burrows, which reduces the driving force for chemical transfer across the burrow walls. Correction for the depletion of O-2 in the burrows results in closer agreement between stochastically- derived and chemically-derived irrigation coefficient profiles.

AB  - Spatial and temporal trends in pore water geochemistry and sediment microbial community structure are compared at three intertidal sites of a saltmarsh on Sapelo Island, GA. The sites include a heavily bioturbated, unvegetated creek bank, a levee with dense growth of Spartina alterniflora. and a more sparsely vegetated ponded marsh site. The redox chemistry of the pore waters ranges from sulfide-dominated at the ponded marsh site to suboxic at the creek bank site. At the three sites. the vertical redox stratification of the pore waters is more compressed in summer than in winter. The trends in redox chemistry reflect opposing effects of sediment respiration and pore water irrigation. Intense and deep burrowing activity by fiddler crabs at the creek bank site results in the efficient oxidation of reduced byproducts of microbial metabolism and, hence, the persistence of suboxic conditions to depths of 50 cm below the sediment surface. Increased supply of labile organic substrates at the vegetated sites promotes microbial degradation processes. leading to sharper redox gradients. At the levee site, this is partly offset by the higher density and deeper penetration of roots and macrofaunal burrows. Surprisingly, the microbial community structure shows little correlation with the variable vertical redox zonation of the pore waters across the saltmarsh. At the three sites, the highest population densities of aerobic microorganisms, iron- plus manganese-reducing bacteria, and sulfate reducers coexist within the upper 10 cm of sediment. The absence of a clear vertical separation of these microorganisms is ascribed to the hi It supply of labile organic matter and intense mixing of the topmost sediment via bioturbation.

AB  - This study was carried out to quantify the effects of higher organisms, invertebrate macrofauna, and macrophyte plants on the rates and pathways of microbial respiration coupled to organic matter oxidation in saltmarsh sediments. Sediment geochemistry, rates of microbial metabolism, and the abundance of anaerobic respiratory bacteria were determined at sites differing in the abundance of fiddler crab (Uca pugnax) burrows and vegetation (Spartina ulterniflora) coverage. Solid-phase Fe(III) concentrations were 50 to 100 times higher, and solid sulfide concentrations were eight times lower in bioturbated, vegetated sediments (BVL) as compared to nonbioturbated, unvegetated (NUC) sediments. Integrated sulfate reduction rates were 10 times lower in BVL (2 mmol m(-2) d(-2)) as compared to NUC sediments (20 mmol m(-2) d(-1)). Directly measured Fe(III) reduction rates were high at the BVL site, whereas no Fe(III) reduction was detected at NUC or in killed sediment treatments. Molybdate, a specific inhibitor of sulfate reduction, inhibited 70% of carbon oxidation when added to NUC sediment but showed no effect on Fe(III) reduction or C oxidation in BVL sediments. Counts of Fe(III)-reducing bacteria (FeRB) were two orders of magnitude higher in BVL sediments (10(7) cells g(-1)) in comparison to NUC sediments (10(5) cells g(-1)). Fe(III) respiration comprised up to 100% of carbon oxidation in BVL sediments, whereas sulfate reduction was the dominant respiration process (greater than or equal to70% of C oxidation) at NUC. We provide strong evidence to show that macroorganisms stimulate FeRB to outcompete sulfate-reducing bacteria in saltmarsh sediments by supplying an abundance of reactive Fe(III) through reoxidation processes.

AB  - This study was undertaken to determine the rates and controls of anaerobic respiration reactions coupled to organic matter mineralization as a function of space and time along a transect from a bioturbated creekbank to the midmarsh in Georgia saltmarsh sediments. Sulfate reduction rates (SRR) were measured at 3 sites during 5 sampling periods throughout the growth season. The sites differed according to hydrologic regime and the abundance of dominant plants and macrofauna. SRR and pore water / solid phase geochemistry showed evidence of enhanced sediment oxidation at sites exposed to intense bioturbation. Iron(III) reduction rates (FeRR) were directly determined in saltmarsh sediments for the first time, and in agreement with measured SRR, higher rates were observed at the bioturbated, unvegetated creekbank (BUC) and bioturbated, vegetated levee (BVL) sites in comparison to a vegetated mid- marsh (MM) site. An unexpected result was the fact that SRR varied nearly as much between sites (2-3 x) as it did with temperature or season (3-4 x). The BVL site, vegetated by the tall form of Spartina alterniflora, always exhibited the highest SRR and carbon oxidation rates (> 4000 nmol cm(-)3 d(- )1) with high activity levels extending deep (greater than or equal to 50 cm) into the sediment, while the MM site, dominated by the short form of Spartina, always exhibited the lowest SRR which were localized to the top 15 cm of sediment. SRR and FeRR at BUC were intermediate between those measured at the BVL and MM. Acetate was the most abundant microbial fermentation product (concentrations up to > 1 mM) in marsh porewaters, and its distribution reflected respiration activity. Chemical exchange, caused by bioturbation, appeared to be the primary control explaining trends in rates of sulfate and Fe(III) reduction with macrophytes and carbon source acting as secondary controls.

AB  - The importance of salt marsh invertebrate biodeposits in biogeochemical cycles is discussed. Yearly biodeposition rates of N, P, K, Mg, Mn, Cu, Zn and Mo are reported for 5 invertebrate species. The 5 spp. (Littorina irrorata, Arcatula demissa, Polymesoda caroliniana, Uca pugnax and U. pugilator) deposit 1709 g dry weight m2 yr-1, of which 455 g m2 yr-1 is organic material. Calculations suggest that the invertebrates are capable of processing 53% of the marsh's yearly production, but the actual amount utilized is probably substantially less than this.

AB  - Objectives of this research were to investigate the functions of the burrow in Uca minax and its possible defense. Functions and defense were determined by excavating 169 burrows during 1981-1982 at the Dennis Creek salt marsh in southern New Jersey and observing 147 marked females and 168 marked males and the aggressive behavior of 161 focal burrow residents. Uca minax constructed hole-type burrows, chimney burrows, and hooded burrows. Each type had characteristic occupants: both males and females in holes, displaying males in hooded burrows, and exclusively ovigerous females in chimney burrows. The entrances to 54% of all burrows were closed by mud plugs at some time during the summer. Male-female pairs and ovigerous females occupied plugged hooded burrows before 7 July, but only single molting males and females were found once reproduction was completed. Hooded and chimney burrows contained a large chamber at the top, were 30-50 cm deep, and had no connections to other burrows. Plugged hooded burrows occupied by ovigerous females were shallower (x = 28.7 cm) and were located closer to the edge of an adjacent creek (x = 1.6 m), than those of other occupant classes. Both males and females occupied individual burrows for up to 18 days at a time. Male burrow residents interacted mostly with other male burrow residents of both U. minax and U. pugnax throughout the season. Female burrow residents interacted mostly with conspecific males and females and with male U. pugnax. This is the first broad front Uca that exhibits female aggression in relation to burrow use. Physical characteristics of the burrows were probably related to burrow function (i.e. reproduction and molting). For example, the lack of burrow interconnections minimizes disturbances by conspecifics or predators. Plugged hooded burrows occupied by ovigerous females provide easy access for larval release. Chimney burrows may serve as a refuge from incoming tides or intruders, or facilitate larval to lease. Burrow residents defended burrows for reproductive purposes early in the season and for molting later on.

AB  - The benthic fauna in mangrove forests is usually dominated by burrowing sesarmid (Grapsidae) and fiddler crabs (Ocypodidae). They are herbivores that retain, bury, macerate and ingest litter and microalgal mats. Most species within these two groups actively dig and maintain burrows in the sediment as a refuge from predation and environmental extremes. Based on the current knowledge on the biology and ecology of these crabs, it seems obvious that their activities have considerable impact on ecosystem functioning. However, no convincing conceptual framework has yet been defined into which the role of these crabs can be identified and characterized. The attributes by which these abundant animals affect the microbial and biogeochemical functional diversity fit well into the concept of ecosystem engineering. The conceptualization of mangrove benthic communities within this framework is distinguished and documented by examples provided from the most recent literature on mangrove ecosystem functioning. It appears that the features and processes driving the engineering effects on distribution and activity of associated organisms operate differently for sesarmid and fiddler crabs. The most obvious and well-documented difference between engineering effects of the two types of crab seems to be associated with foraging. More attention must be devoted in the future to elucidate engineering aspects related to crab burrows in mangrove environments. Particularly comparative work on the burrow-dwelling life styles of the two types of crab is needed. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The influence of mangrove saplings (Avicennia marina) and fiddler crabs (Uca vocans) on carbon, iron, and sulfur biogeochernistry in mangrove sediment was studied using outdoor mesocosms with and without plants (21 m(-2)) and crabs (68 m(-2)). Saplings grew more leaves and pneumatophores in the presence of crabs. Dense microalgal mats lead to two to six times higher benthic production and about two times higher benthic respiration in the absence of crabs. Particle mixing by crabs increased the reactive oxidized iron (Fe(III)) in the upper 2 cm of the sediment, whereas oxygen leaching by roots maintained the deeper rhizosphere oxidized and enriched in Fe(III). The highest microbial activity, measured as carbon dioxide production and iron reduction, occurred within the upper 2 cm of ungrazed sediment and was fueled by the large near-surface biomass of microalgae. Leaching of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from roots stimulated bulk sulfate reduction and caused an upward cascading reduction of the sediment as indicated by low Fe(III) and high Fe(II) between 2-cm and 6-cm depth. The effect DOC was also evident as increased microbial abundance at all depths in the sediment. Fe(III) was the most important electron acceptor for microbial carbon oxidation in ungrazed sediment (63-70%), whereas sulfate reduction was more important in grazed sediment (36-44%), particularly in the presence of plants. Aerobic respiration always accounted for < 20%. Fiddler crabs and roots of A. marina have complementary effects on the biogeochemistry of mangrove sediment. Their association seems to be mutually beneficial with respect to growth and food availability.

AB  - Organismal coloration is used for communication, camouflage, and thermoregulation. These functions of body coloration may impose conflicting demands upon color-changing organisms. Here, we examined interacting thermoregulatory and camouflage color change responses when fiddler crabs Uca panacea were subject to simultaneously changing temperatures (10, 25, 40 A degrees C) and backgrounds (black, white). Crab coloration lightened on a white background and at high temperatures and darkened on a black background and at low temperatures, reflecting the camouflage and thermoregulatory functions of color change. Synergistic background and temperature treatments (i.e., hot/white or cold/black) induced strong color change responses. When temperature and background were in conflict (i.e., hot/black or cold/white), responses to background coloration constrained thermoregulatory color change such that carapace coloration did not change. Such conflicts are likely to be common in nature, especially in highly heterogeneous environments. Throughout the experiment, males remained lighter than females and showed a greater response to the hot/white treatment, driven by a stronger response to high temperatures. These differences may reflect the physiological, morphological, and behavioral differences associated with sexual selection and sexual dimorphism in this species.

AB  - Mangroves function as important shelter and feeding habitats for marine fauna, but the degree to which mangrove-derived carbon contributes to local food webs has long been debated. In this study, stable isotope analysis was used as a technique to elucidate the role of mangrove carbon in the diets of the macroinvertebrate and fish fauna of an intertidal fringing mangrove forest and adjacent intertidal/subtidal mudflats in a macrotidal Tanzanian estuary. The expectation was that sessile species and those with low motility depend to a larger extent on local carbon sources than highly motile species. A clear distinction in delta(13)C was present between primary producers from mangrove and mudflat habitats. Macroinvertebrates revealed a gradient in their delta(13)C where Sesarma crabs were the only species that directly utilised mangrove carbon by feeding on mangrove leaves/detritus. Uca crabs and the gastropod Littoraria scabra showed a higher dependence on microphytobenthos from the mangrove substratum. Among the fish fauna, the amphibious mudskipper was the only species to which the mangroves were accessible during low tide. Consequently this was the only fish species for which it was clear that it fed in the mangrove habitat, most commonly on mangrove-associated Uca crabs. All other species of sessile as well as motile macroinvertebrates and fish from the mangrove and mudflat habitat showed a high degree of utilisation of mudflat carbon. Overall, mangrove carbon thus contributed little to the mangrove and mudflat food webs, despite the high tidal amplitude and the resulting potential for exchange of carbon and fauna in the estuary studied here. Utilisation of mangrove carbon appears to depend more on the ecology of the species in consideration (e.g., species-specific use of zones within the mangrove habitat) than on their potential motility or tolerance to exposure during low tide.

AB  - On macrotidal coasts, short- to medium term variations in feeding of intertidal fishes are influenced by several interacting time scales. To identify the driver of major variations in the feeding habits of intertidal fish, we used the pemecou sea catfish Sciades herzbergii (Ariidae), an abundant intertidal benthic second order consumer, as a model species. We analyzed the influence of the spring-neap and the day-night cycle on intertidal abundance, stomach fullness, diet composition and food consumption of S. herzbergii using block nets set at slack high tides in two mangrove creeks in north Brazil. At spring tides, intertidal abundance, stomach fullness, and total daily consumption of S. herzbergii were on average 8.8, 1.9, and 3.8 times higher than at neap tides, respectively. At spring tides, Uca spp. and Grapsidae (mostly Pachygrapsus gracilis) dominated the diet, irrespective of the time of day. Other important food items were Insecta and the semiterrestrial crab Ucides cordatus. At neap tides, Capitellidae contributed to the diet of nightly inundations while no specimens were caught at daytime. Creek location had no effect on any variable. Results from our study area and evidence from other studies suggest that the spring-neap tide pulse is likely the major driver of short- to medium term variations in feeding of intertidal fishes. This has important implications for feeding-related issues on macro- and probably also on mesotidal coasts: (i) juvenile fishes may have fortnightly growth spurts, (ii) intertidal prey populations may suffer regular fluctuations in mortality, (iii) studies of the feeding ecology of intertidal fishes should cover the combined effects of the tidal, diet, lunar and seasonal cycles, and (iv) the modeling of food webs should consider the differences between highly dynamic spring tide and quieter neap tide conditions.

AB  - 1. Pretreatment of isolated eyestalk tissues of the fiddler crab, Uca pugilator, with drugs that interfere with norepinephrinergic neurotransmission, alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine, fusaric acid, 6-hydroxydopamine, and bretylium, prior to electrical stimulation resulted in the release of significantly less black pigment-dispersing hormone (BPDH) and light-adapting hormone (LAH) than from tissues that had been kept in saline alone prior to being electrically stimulated.

2. These data support the hypothesis that norepinephrine has a physiological role in stimulating release of BPDH and LAH in the fiddler crab.

AB  - 1. Previously, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) had been found to stimulate ovarian development in the fiddler crab, Uca pugilator. The present study was designed to provide supporting evidence for this earlier observation by determining the effects of two 5-HT agonists on ovarian development in this crab. For this purpose the 5-HT releaser fenfluramine and the 5-HT potentiator fluoxetine were used.

2. The ovaries of crabs that received fenfluramine, fluoxetine, 5-HT alone, 5-HT plus fenfluramine, or 5-HT plus fluoxetine exhibited significant increases in ovarian index and oocyte size as compared to the ovaries of untreated initial control crabs and saline-injected concurrent control specimens.

3. These results are discussed in relation to the hypothesis that 5-HT exerts its effect on the ovary indirectly, by stimulating release of an ovary-stimulating neurohormone.

AB  - 1. Signals used during male combat are expected to be honest indicators of fighting ability. However, recent studies show that dishonesty in male signalling is more prevalent than previously believed. 2. Here we show that regenerated (leptochelous) claws in male Uca mjoebergi fiddler crabs are not only dishonest signals of two types of whole-organism performance capacities that are likely to be useful during fights (claw closing force and pull-resisting force), but they are also less effective as weapons in situations where males are unable to bluff. 3. Original (brachychelous) male claws are statistically significant predictors (independent of body size) of both closing force and the force required to pull a male out of a tunnel. By contrast, leptochelous claw size does not convey information on those performance capacities following control for body size. 4. Furthermore, claw size affects fighting ability such that leptochelous residents are at a significant competitive disadvantage to brachychelous residents, although claw type does not affect the ability of non-resident males to win fights. 5. This study is among the first to show that male armaments can dishonestly signal performance traits that are likely important for winning fights, and is the first to show evidence for dishonest signalling of multiple components of fighting ability.

AB  - Larvae of 15 species or genera of crabs were collected and identified during a six month (May 26 to October 28, 1978) study in the mouth of Delaware Bay. Seasonal abundance and vertical distribution of each species were investigated. Most species studied had peak abundance in July and August except for Cancer irroratus and Ovalipes ocellatus which showed peak occurrence in May and June, respectively. Larvae of species strongly dependent on estuarine habitats, such as Uca spp., Pinnixa chaetopterana, and P. sayana, showed a tendency to congregate in near-bottom waters where net flow of water is landward, thus favoring retention within the estuary. Larvae of Ovalipes ocellatus, Cancer irroratus, and Callinectes sapidus were more common at the surface. This vertical distribution suggests that these larvae are flushed out of the estuary. The mechanisms of recruitment and replenishment of adult populations within the estuary would therefore depend on migration of megalopa and juveniles.

AB  - The distribution of resolution around the eye of the fiddler crab Uca pugilator was measured using the pseudopupil, and the results were compared with various behavioural thresholds. As noted previously (Zeil et al. 1986) the eye has a band of greatly increased vertical resolution around the middle with inter-ommatidial angles as small as 1 degrees (Figs. 1-3). In life this band images the horizon. The horizontal resolution is nearly constant throughout the eye. Males notice females when they subtend 2 to 3 inter-ommatidial angles, and distinguish males from females when they subtend 6 to 7 ommatidia (Fig. 6). Potential predators are detected when they subtend only one inter-ommatidial angle, and move through a similar angle. Using models, it was found that males respond to moving objects of the right size as though they were conspecifics, although they do not resemble crabs in shape, It is concluded that only one feature distinguishes other crabs from predators: whether they appear below or above the crab's horizon.

AB  - Male fiddler crabs (Uca pugilator Bose) have visual control systems that enable them to track other crabs in front or behind, and to keep potential predators to the side, where escape is easiest. The system for tracking conspecifics appears to be double, with a low-gain velocity-sensitive mechanism operating over about a 90 degrees range, backed up by a position-sensitive mechanism at the ends of this range which is responsible for recentring the target. This system has separate front and rear ranges, with a gap in the direction of the claw. The crabs separately fixate the burrow entrance, keeping it in the direction opposite the claw. Predator evasion employs two systems simultaneously. An open-loop mechanism directs the crab's translatory movements directly away from the stimulus, and a rotational mechanism using continuous feedback turns the crab so that the stimulus is kept at near 90 degrees to the body axis. Both systems are sensitive to the angular position of the stimulus, not its velocity. Eye movements have little or no role in object tracking. An attempt is made to list Uca's known visual control systems.

AB  - Similar to many other species of fiddler crabs, the interactions of Uca tangeri are influenced by 2 characteristic visual signals: the waving display performed by males with their enlarged claw, and the building of structures (mudballs) around the burrow entrance. This study focused on male signalling, male-male competition and female mate choice. Female choice and male mating success were investigated by looking at male quality, male visual signals (waving activity and mudballs) and male interactions and their outcome. Fieldwork was carried out in June and July 1997 at the Ria Formosa Natural Park, Algarve, Portugal, on a sandy beach with an average population density of 2.06 burrows m(-2). Behavioural observations of focal males were made at low tide, 1 h before and after the peak of low tide, that is during the mudballing phase or interaction phase. This was also when measurements of male characteristics, mudballs and burrow characteristics were taken. The results show that the quality of a male's burrow is related to its depth, and depth is correlated with 4 features: claw size, waving rate, mean distance to mudballs and number of mudballs. Therefore, females could use these features as indicators of gallery depth, eliminating the need to enter the burrow for sampling. Males compete for the possession of burrows that are more visited by females, thus taking over burrows is an alternative strategy to burrow digging. Male waving activity, mudball distance and claw size can be considered as multiple visual signals available to females for mate choice. Females' first choice criterion would seem to be burrow quality.

AB  - The morphology of the reproductive organs of three species of fiddler crabs, Uca ecuadoriensis, Uca c.f forcipata, and Uca tangeri were investigated to subsequently produce a model of their mode of operation. Vulva, vagina, and spermatheca in females, and the first and second gonopods in males were examined by applying histological techniques and electron microscopy. In all three species, vulva and vagina conform to the concave type, and the spermatheca complies with the ventral type. The tissue of the oviduct orifice is enlarged and bulges into the lumen of the spermatheca. Differences between the three species are apparent in the organization of the spermatheca, especially in the distribution and structure of glandular epithelium: In U. ecuadoriensis and U. c.f forcipata the largest proportion of the spermathecal wall is lined with cuticle and only a small area consists of glandular epithelium, while in U. tangeri almost all of the lining is glandular. Furthermore, the glandular epithelia of the species differ in their histology and ultrastructure: In U. ecuadoriensis it is tubular and multilayered, while in U. c.f forcipata it is mono-layered. U. tangeri finally has both forms of this tissue. In the males, the terminal segments of the first gonopod exhibit a tight fit to female organs and narrow, tightly sealed sperm channels. These features suggest a tendency towards minimizing loss of fluids, which can be interpreted as an adaptation to mating on land. The tight fit of male gonopod and female opening seem to be protection from interbreeding, which points toward a strong sexual selection. In the terrestrial environment, these originally aquatic organisms experience serious competition for resources; therefore there is pressure on successful reproduction. According to the current results a model of the process of fertilization and egg-laying involving the investigated organs was generated. J. Morphol. 271:1281-1299, 2010. (C) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - The relative growth of the fiddler crab Uca sindensis in Pohl Port was studied. Ten 0.5 m(2) quadrates were randomly sampled monthly during low tide periods from October 2009 to September 2010. A total of 840 crabs, 449 (53.45%) males and 391(46.5%) females, were sampled. The Carapace width of males ranged from 5.5 to13.5 mm (mean +/- SD) (8.92 +/- 2.04), and of females from 5.0 to 11.5 mm (mean +/- SD) (7.95 +/- 1.34). Carapace height (CH) and Carapace length(CL), height of the major cheliped (HMC) of males, abdomen width of females (AW), major cheliped length (LMC), dactiluse (D), feeding cheliped (CHF) and merouse (M) were employed as dependent variables and carapace width(CW) as independent variable. The relationship between CW x CH was positive in males and females. The equation (Log CH=Log-4.881+4.681LogCW) for males (P<0.05) and Log CH=Log-1.882+3.299LogCW for females (P<0.05). The females showed allometric positive growth for CW x AW relation to male (Log AW=Log0.784+1.217Log CW) (P<0.05). Also four male crabs were found with two major cheliped in this study. Remarkable ontogenetic changes were observed in the allometric growth of the male major cheliped and the female abdomen, indicating that these structures are closely connected to the timing of sexual maturity. The allometric growth of U. sindensis in Pohl Port mangrove differed from other Uca populations so far studied, indicating that growth could have been influenced by environment variables such as food availability, population density, distribution of vegetation, sex ratio, soil temperature, organic matter, different of surface and sediment.

AB  - The sand fiddler crab Uca pugilator was used as a model to study the mechanisms and behavioral functions of eye stability. This study had 3 objectives: (1) to create a model of the interactions between the optokinetic and locomotory systems; (2) to determine the minimum stability required by the eyes to preserve image resolution; (3) to demonstrate how and why the eyes of fiddler crabs are stabilized in the vertical planes, and oriented perpendicular to the local substrate. The sensory modalities contributing to horizontal eye stalk stability were identified as vision, the statocyst semi-circular canal system, and the leg proprioceptor system. Both the optokinetic and course control. systems were shown to operate by visual feedback loops, with the slip between the retina and the environment as their inputs. Using open- and closed-loop experiments with respect to both optokinesis and course control, the following were shown: (i) the visual signal in the optokinetic loop is inhibited between the retina and the eye stalk muscles by the leg proprioceptors; (ii) the course control gain must be equal to the optokinetic gain, and these must both be equal to the reciprocal of leg proprioceptor gain (open-loop gains all); (iii) course control is blocked and the visual signal is not inhibited when the animal attempts to escape. This may allow the animal to orient its body to the threat only, rather than to the visual surround. The length of temporal summation by the photoreceptors was estimated from both the frequency response and response duration of the E.R.G. This value was combined with the photoreceptor acceptance angle (width-at-half-height), to calculate the minimum image velocity that would degrade image contrast. This velocity is roughly ten times faster than what the eyes of crabs in nature experience, suggesting image quality is not the limiting factor in eye stability. The sensory modalities contributing to vertical eye stalk stability were identified as vision and the statocyst semi-circular canals. Using the escape response to artificial stimuli, crabs were found to escape only from objects above their retinal horizon, regardless of how this horizon was oriented in space.

AB  - Fiddler crabs (Uca pugilator Bose; Crustacea, Decapoda) feed and court in open, flat spaces. Their visual system has several putative adaptations to their flat habitat, including the tendency to keep the vertical axis of their eyes perpendicular to the plane of the substratum. It is hypothesized that one of the functions of this behavior is to distinguish accurately predators from conspecifics by aligning the region of the eye sensitive to predators with the region in space in which predators occur. To test this hypothesis, a crab was placed in a glass dish? and a moving stimulus was presented between 20 degrees above and below eye level (horizontal), Stimuli below the crab's horizon hardly ever evoked escape responses, while identical stimuli above the horizon produced escape responses whose frequency varied with the angular size, not the absolute size, of the stimulus. Experiments with artificial horizons showed that it is the position of the stimulus relative to the eye that is important, rather than its position relative to external cues such as the visible horizon, the vertical light gradient or the gravitational horizon. It is concluded that a crab responds to stimuli according to their position relative to its retinal equator. This conclusion is discussed in light of the crabs' natural behavior with respect to supra-horizontal stimuli.

AB  - Fiddler crabs Uca rapax are central-place foragers, making feeding excursions of up to 2m from their burrows. We describe the natural feeding excursions of path-integrating fiddler crabs and analyze their paths for signs of significant systematic or random navigation errors. No signs of any systematic errors are evident. Random errors are small, probably due to a combination of the short length and low sinuosity of the foraging paths, as well as the fiddler crabs' unique method of locomotion that allows them to remain oriented to their burrows throughout the foraging path and to minimize large body turns. We further examined the extent to which their body orientation during foraging (transverse body axis pointing more or less towards home) accurately represented their stored home vector. By examining sequences of fast escape, we have shown that crabs can correct for deviations of their transverse body axis from home during their escape path. Thus their stored home vector is independent of their moment-to-moment body orientation.Crabs were subjected to passive translational displacements and barrier obstructions. Responses to translational displacements were identical to those observed by previous authors, namely that crabs returned in the correct egocentric direction and distance as though no displacement had occurred. Covering the burrow entrance resulted in crabs returning to the correct position of the burrow, and then beginning to search. When a barrier was placed between foraging crabs and their burrow, crabs oriented their bodies toward the burrow as accurately as with no barrier.

AB  - Fiddler crabs Uca rapax are central-place foragers, making feeding excursions of up to several meters from their burrows. This study investigates the sources of directional and distance information used by these crabs when returning to their burrows. We tested the spatial frame of reference (egocentric or exocentric), and the source of spatial information (idiothetic or allothetic) used during homing. We also tested which components of their locomotion they integrated (only voluntary, or voluntary plus reflexive).Fiddler crabs in their natural mudflat habitat were passively rotated during normal foraging behavior using experimenter-controlled disks, before they returned home. Crabs resisted passive rotations on the disk by counter-rotating when the disk turned, which was a compensatory response to unintended movement. Crabs were usually situated eccentrically on the disk, and therefore were also subjected to a translation when the disk rotated. No crab actively compensated for this translation. Crabs that fully compensated for disk rotation made no directional homing error. Crabs that did not fully compensate homed in a direction that reflected their new body orientation. In other words, if we succeeded in reorienting a crab (i.e. it undercompensated for disk rotation), its homing error was equal to the angle by which it had been reoriented, regardless of the magnitude of the optomotor compensation.Computer-modelled crabs, each equipped with a path integrator utilizing different combinations of external (allothetic) and path-related (idiothetic) input, traversed the digitized paths of the real crabs. The home vector computed by the model crab was then compared to the homing direction observed in the real crab. The model home vector that most closely matched that of the real crab was taken to comprise the path integration mechanism employed by fiddler crabs. The model that best matched the real crab gained direction and distance idiothetically (from internal sources such as proprioceptors), and integrated only voluntary locomotory information.Crabs were also made to run home across a patch of wet acetate, on which they slipped and were thus forced to take more steps on the homeward path than theoretically required by the home vector. Crabs whose running velocity across the patch was unusually low also stopped short of their burrow before finding it. Crabs whose running velocity was not impeded by the patch did not stop short, but ran straight to the burrow entrance, as did control crabs that ran home with no slippery patch. We interpret this to mean that the velocity of some crabs was impeded because of slipping, and these therefore stopped short of their burrow after having run out their homing vector. This is positive evidence in support of the hypothesis that path integration is mediated either by leg proprioceptors or by efferent commands, but our data do not allow us to distinguish between these two possibilities.

AB  - Male fiddler crabs, Uca pugilator (Crustacea: Decapoda), respond to conspecifics by claw waving, and to predators by freezing or escape. In field experiments it was found that this distinction was not made on the basis of angular size and speed, nor was shape important. The remaining possibilities were either the absolute size of the stimulus, determined from angular size and distance, or the position of the stimulus relative to the horizon. To distinguish between these, a crab was placed in a glass dish, and moved black stimuli on a white background, at a distance of 22 cm. Stimuli below the crab's horizon hardly ever evoked escape. However, identical stimuli partially or wholly above the crab's horizon produced escape responses whose frequency varied with the angular size of the stimulus. Halving the distance of the stimulus showed that it was angular and not absolute size that determines escape frequency; and experiments with a tilted horizon showed that it is the position of the stimulus relative to the eye equator that is important, rather than the geographical horizon itself. It has been concluded that crabs categorize stimuli as dangerous or otherwise by their position relative to the crabs' visual horizon.

AB  - The primary structure of the Hypoderma lineatum collagenase was determined. Chymotrypsin digestion and thermolysin fragmentation of the chymotryptic core gave 30 and 5 peptides, respectively, accounting for all the residues of the protein. These peptides were aligned with overlapping peptides derived from tryptic and Staphylococcus aureus V8 proteinase digests. Hypoderma collagenase is a serine proteinase composed of 230 amino acids (Mr 23,223). It displays a high degree of sequential homology with the serine proteinases of the trypsin family, especially with another collagenolytic enzyme, the proteinase I of crab Uca pugilator. The six half-cystinyl residues of Hypoderma collagenase correspond to 6 of the 10 half-cystinyl residues of chymotrypsin, and the residues forming the charge-relay system of the active site of chymotrypsin (His-57, Asp-102, and Ser-195) are found in corresponding regions. The prediction of the secondary structure of the collagenase is given.

AB  - Excessive mangrove spreading causes a significant impact upon the ecosystem and flood control operations in the Guandu mangrove wetland (Guandu Natural Reserve), Taiwan. Aerial photos, taken between 1978 and 1994, reveal that marsh habitats, dominated by Cyperus malaccensis Lam. and Phragmites communis (L.) Trin., have changed into a swamp habitat, dominated by Kandelia candel (L.) Druce. The coverage area of K. candel has increased from 0.04 ha in 1978 to 20.75 ha in 1994. The Kandelia habitat was more salty and located at a higher ground surface elevation than was the P communis habitat. Variations of the water surface elevation and reduction of the channel conveyance due to increase of the coverage area of K. candel (L.) Druce were also obtained in this study. A horizontal two-dimensional model, TABS-2, was applied in this study to simulate the hydraulic and sediment transport characteristics of this estuary wetland. Four cases with different removal ratios show that water surface elevation decreases as the removal ratio increases. When the removal ratio of Kandelia reaches 20%, variations of the water surface elevation in the wetland became insignificant. Significant sediment deposition occurs due to the extensive root network of Kandelia. The average deposition is about 33 mm during a 200-year return period flood event. Removal of Kandelia reduces the sediment deposition rate. When the removal ratio reaches 20%, the reduction in sediment deposition is about 5 mm. Considering the factors of flood protection and sediment deposition, the optimal removal ratio is between 10 and 20%. It also found that mangrove removal improves the ecological restoration of Uca (Thalassuca) Formosensis Rathbun, an endemic species of the fiddler crab in Taiwan. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The cyst wall of the metacercaria of Gynaecotyla adunca (Microphallidae: Digenea) was subjected to comprehensive histochemical analysis. At the Light microscope level, a uniformly thick, bipartite cyst wall, probably wholly of parasite origin, was evident. Structural modification of the cyst wall to provide an escape aperture was not apparent. The thicker, inner layer was comprised of phospholipid and glyco- and/or mucoproteins, possibly similar in structure to collagen. The outer layer was highly proteinaceous and contained additional amounts of acidic and neutral mucosubstances. The results are discussed in the context of previous observations regarding the excystment requirements of this microphallid species.

AB  - Study on ecology and behavior of Uca formosensis was carried out on a mud-flat located in Hsih-gu district of Chang-hua County from March 1990 to September 1990.

 From the study area (upper intertidal zone and spray zone in vicinity of the embankment), preliminary data on the distribution pattern of U. formosensis were obtained. Morphological measurements such as sizes of the carapace and major cheliped of male individuals were also recorded for the first time in this species. The population of U. formosensis is not randomly distributed but in aggregation. The sex ratio of male to female is approximately 2:1.

 Feeding is the most frequently observed behavior. The fiddler crabs use their minor chelipeds to grip mud on the ground surface, they feed on organic debris in the mud. The feeding frequency of male crabs in unit time (30 seconds) is lower than that of the females because each male has only one minor cheliped for feeding. The smaller the individual is, the faster is its eating rate.

 In other behavioral aspects, the waving of major chelip@ of male U. formosensis belongs to vertical waving display. Mating occurs near the entrance of the burrow of the female crab, and lasts for about 2.5 minutes. During mating, they pair up with ventral bodies sticking together and remain motionless. The male crab does not wave its major cheliped to attract the female before mating. Territory is not explicitly defined in U. formosensi .s, but some individuals have shown behavior to protect their own burrows. When other crabs approach a burrow, its inhabitant would rush back to its burrow or wave its chelipeds at the opening to expel the intruders.

 The changes in quantity of U. formosensis outside the burrow are affected by the factor whether the tide will cover the burrows or not. In the spray zone, the fiddler crabs become more active in the spring tide period. The fiddler crabs reside in the burrows when the burrows are covered by seei water. As the tide retreats, they go out of their burrows and behave actively. Most fiddler crabs enter their burrows after sunset.

 The behavior of U. formosensis to seal its burrow is related to the flow of the sea and sunset. Their way of transporting mud plugs out of the burrows, may be related to the maintenance or deepening of the burrow.

 The opening of the burrows of U. formosensis is round in shape, usually without extruding structures such as hood or chimney. There is no typical shape for the burrows. 89% of the burrows have their lower portions vertical to the ground. The depth of the burrows can reach 73cm below the ground surface. The radius of a burrow is directly proportional to the width of the carapace of its inhabitant.

AB  - The predatory xanthid crabs Eurytium Limosum and Panopeus herbstii are common components of benthic assemblages in different intertidal habitats within salt marshes around Sapelo Island, Georgia, USA, E. limosum feed primarily on other crabs and are found where cordgrass Spartina alterniflora stems are the dominant structural elements in the environment. P herbstii feed largely on bivalve molluscs and are abundant in intertidal creeks where oyster Crassostrea virginica reefs are the predominant structural elements. We designed laboratory experiments to measure prey consumption rates by these 2 predators under conditions that simulated those experienced by each species in its respective habitat. Biogenic structure within the environment of each species reduced prey consumption rates. The mean (+/- SD) number of fiddler crabs Uca pugnax killed in 24 h by E. Limosum was less (2.0 +/- 0.87 individuals) in the presence of stems than in their absence (2.9 +/- 1.63 individuals). Fiddler crabs had no refuge in size from predation by E. limosum. However, mortality rates of fiddler crabs exposed to predation by E. Limosum were sex-dependent. Males of U. pugnax sometimes escaped the predator's grasp by autotomizing their prominent major chela and consequently when prey were offered in an equal sex ratio significantly (paired t-test, p = 0.03) fewer males (4.3 +/- 2.55) than females (5.7 +/- 2.65) were killed by E. limosum in 48 h. We believe that predation by mud crabs may contribute to male-biased sex ratios that are commonly observed in natural populations of fiddler crabs. Oyster shell clumps influenced the predator-prey interaction between Fl herbstii and the ribbed mussel Geukensia demissa in a simulated intertidal creek environment. Mussels attached to the exterior (exposed) surfaces of an oyster clump suffered a 3.5 times greater mortality than those attached to the inside (concealed) surface of the clump. Results of previous studies in which prey were offered as isolated individuals suggest that P. herbstii should have the greatest impact on small (< 20 mm shell length) mussels. However, by simulating natural conditions, we showed that predation by P. herbstii inflicted the greatest mortality on mussels of intermediate (20 to 40 mm shell length) size because larger mussels have a refuge in size and small mussels have a spatial refuge within the interstices of oyster clumps. Our findings suggest that xanthid crabs have a greater impact within salt marsh communities than previously recognized and emphasize the importance of using 'context-sensitive' experiments to explore predator-prey interactions.

AB  - Hydrophobic pollutants, in particular sediment-sorbed organic compounds, are widespread in the aquatic environment and could represent a threat to living organisms. Estuarine species, which live in turbulent ecosystems, are particularly exposed to this mode of contamination. For precise evaluation of the toxicity of hydrophobic contaminants desorbed from particles, a new larval assay using nauplii of the estuarine calanoid copepod Eutytemora affinis was developed. It consists of the direct exposure of copepods during naupliar development to elutriates of an unpolluted sediment spiked with different model contaminants. This bioassay measures the toxicity of the bioavailable fraction of particle-sorbed pollutants on the naupliar stage of copepods. Mortality and growth (non-invasive endpoints) in nauplii were analysed after six days of exposure. This approach was validated using six pollutants with different modes of action: benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), dimethylbenzo[a]anthracene (DMBA), phenanthrene (PHE), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB 126, PCB 153) and 4-nonylphenol (4-NP). All these compounds induced a dose-dependent increase in toxic effects. Lethal effects only occurred at the highest tested concentrations: 58,541 and 6092 ng g(-1) dry weight sediment (dws), for PHE and DMBA, respectively. Sublethal effects (growth inhibition) were observed at lower concentrations for all tested compounds except PCB 153, from 8, 142, 297, 6092 and 8453 ng g(-1) dws for PCB 126, BaP, PHE, DMBA and 4-NP, respectively.

AB  - Early succession of macrofauna was examined over several years in a created Spartina alterniflora marsh located on the Newport River Estuary, North Carolina, USA. Epifauna and infaunal community structure and composition were compared at 2 elevations in plots planted with S. alterniflora, plots left bare of vegetation and vegetated plots in a nearby natural S. alterniflora marsh. No significant successional differences were observed between vegetated and unvegetated sediments in the created marsh. The earliest stages of colonization involved recruitment by opportunistic estuarine polychaetes: Streblospio benedicti, Capitella spp. and Polydora cornuta. Capitella spp. dominated the macrofauna a month after marsh creation, but thereafter S. benedicti was the most abundant species. During the first few years, the artificial marsh retained early successional characteristics, with S. benedicti, Capitella spp. and turbellarians accounting for 75 to 95% of the total macrofauna. Fiddler crabs were common epifaunal colonists. After 4 yr, species richness increased and dominance by the early colonists diminished. Taxa lacking planktonic larvae and swimming adults were particularly slow to recover in the created marsh, but accounted for over 25% of the infauna by Year 4. Oligochaetes, which comprised over 50% of the fauna in the natural marsh, remained absent or rare in the artificial system throughout the study. Infaunal recovery appears to be more rapid in lower than upper marsh elevations. Although macrofaunal densities and species richness of sediments in the lower created marsh came to resemble those of the natural marsh within 6 mo, species composition and faunal feeding modes did not. These observations suggest there may be significant functional differences between young artificial marshes and older natural marshes.

AB  - 1. Previous evidence demonstrates that closing force decreases proportionally as fiddler crab claw size increases. Larger crabs do have greater absolute closing force, but less than would be expected if claw proportions were isometric. In the Mud Fiddler Crab, Uca pugnax, this is explained by a decrease in mechanical advantage with increasing claw size. 2. We here re-measure mechanical advantage with a more direct method than used previously; the relationship of mechanical advantage to claw size was similar to the older indirect measure. Because the fiddler crab claw is a simple lever, we predicted that the observed decline in closing force should be compensated by a proportional increase in closing speed. 3. We tested this hypothesis using high-speed video to observe crabs closing their major claws spontaneously under controlled conditions. Closing speed scaled positively to claw length as predicted, and the value of the exponent conformed to expectation from a simple biomechanical model. 4. Evolution of the fiddler crab claw therefore involved a trade-off of closing force for closing speed. An adaptive explanation of relative weakening with increasing body size may lie in the increased ability to rapidly grasp an opponent, a crucial advantage in fiddler crab combat.

AB  - 1. We measured the closing force of the major claw of live fiddler crabs (Uca pugnax), using a flexible beam equipped with strain gauges and connected to a Wheatstone bridge and computer.

2. Crabs usually produced a series of rhythmic contractions. Maximum closing force of an individual was related approximately linearly to claw length.

3. Closing force scaled as predicted from the force expected from dimensions used to calculate muscle cross-sectional area and mechanical advantage. This suggests that the major claw, which is an extreme case of sexual selection, is fully functional as a closing device, rather than losing the closing force function, which might be expected if it was used primarily as a display to signal body size to other males or females.

AB  - We studied the functional differentiation between the major and minor claws of fiddler crabs (Uca, family Ocypodidae) by means of a strain gauge apPARATUS and by morphometric estimates of claw function, In Uca pugnax, (Smith 1870) closing force is an approximately log-linear function of claw length, but the slope for minor claws is greater than that for the major claws, and the gamma-intercept for major claws is displaced upwards from that of the minor claw. The pattern of closure also differs: major claws impart rhythmic short pulls, whereas minor claws squeeze far more irregularly, The short pulls of the major claw correspond to rapid squeezes observed in videotapes of combat, whereas the irregular pulls of the minor claw match expectations for gathering particles and transferring them to the mouth parts. The mechanical advantage declines steadily with increasing major claw length, These results suggest that the evolution of form of the extremely large major claws in fiddler crabs involved functional shifts, as opposed to a developmentally constrained extrapolation in size of the minor claw.

AB  - Phylogenetic analyses of sequences of 16S rDNA suggest that the current hypothesis of the evolution of the pan-tropical fiddler crab genus Uca (Decapoda, Brachyura, Ocypodidae) is false. This hypothesis rests of the assumption that the increase of complexity of reproductive behavior, together with a tendency of a habitat shift towards the higher intertidal, arose only once in the history of the fiddler crabs. The origin of fiddler crabs was placed in the IndoPacific, which is widely thought to be a center of origin for several marine groups. There, relatively lower intertidal crabs were thought to give rise to a radiation in the Americas in which higher intertidal forms with more complex reproductive behavior evolved, and finally, derived crabs were thought to disperse back to the IndoPacific from the Americas, In contrast our phylogeny suggests that the ancestral group, which shows complex reproductive behavior, now resides wholly in the American-Atlantic region, as opposed to the postulated Indo-west-Pacific. Behavioral and ecological complexity must have arisen independently in the American and IndoPacific faunal regions. The pan-tropical subgenus Celuca seems to be polyphyletic, which suggests that the evolution of morphology, ecology and behavior involves convergence in geographically separated locales. This study highlights the dangers of postulating evolution from a center of origin, even if it fits data that can be assigned to an evolutionary trend.

Canonical discriminant analysis (CDA) was applied to identify an existing habitat type's scheme by identifying the physico-chemical properties of sediment in Hsiang-Shan wetland. The three constructed discriminant functions (CDFs) showed a marked contribution by most of the discriminant variables, and the recognition capacities in these three CDFs were 49.5, 32.8 and 17.7%. Our study revealed that the most important latent factors in Hsiang-Shan wetland are soil texture-caused factor, ocean current-caused factor, nutrient-caused factor, and the redox reaction-caused factor. And the most sensitivity parameters in this habitat followed the descending order: OBD, EC, Eh, sand, TN, porosity, STP, silt, VCP and pH. And the inhabited sediment properties for U. formosensis in terms of soil texture are sand, silt, and clay (34.05, 29.72, and 32.35%, respectively): that is clay loam soil. We also found that U. formosensis preferred to inhabit the upper intertidal zone, spending 8.41% of the time submerged. Vegetation coverage on the ground was less than 2.20%, showing that it preferred to live in a bare intertidal habitat. Concerning nest choosing, excavating burrows is more difficult when a high soil penetration force is required, and in this study the soil penetration force for 20 cm was found to be is 45.98 N/cm(2). The results will be helpful in developing a methodology for use by the government in refining its management programs.

AB  - The density of spoon-tipped setae (ST setae) along the inner edge of the merus of the left second maxilliped of two Singapore species of fiddler crabs, Uca annulipes and U. vocans, was studied. A larger proportion of the inner merus edge was covered with ST setae in U. annulipes as compared to U. vocans (two-thirds vs. half of the edge, respectively). The number of ST setae did not differ significantly between males and females in both species (ANCOVA, slopes and intercepts, p > 0.05) suggesting there is no sexual dimorphism in mouthpart adaptations for these species. The combined regression equation (male + female data; CW = carapace width) for U. annulipes (n = 91) was #ST setae = 15.6 + 14.7CW with r(2) = 0.63, that for U. vocans (n = 100) being #ST setae = 32.4 + 9.91CW with r(2) = 0.66. For any given size of crab, significantly more ST setae were present in Uca annulipes (a sandy habitat crab) than in U. vocans (a muddy habitat species). These results provide quantitative evidence that fiddler crabs that inhabit sandy habitats possess more ST setae (an adaptation for processing sandy sediments), than those occurring in muddy habitats.

AB  - Dimensions of crab burrows were compared in two sympatric populations of fiddler crabs, Uca vocans and U. annulipes, to determine interspecies variation. Nine dimensions of burrow architecture were defined from 62 complete burrow casts of U. vocans: burrow diameter, BD; burrow volume, BV; total burrow depth, TBD; burrow neck height, BNH; curved burrow length, CBL; horizontal length, HL; chamber diameter, CD; angle between descending neck of burrow and the substrate surface, P; angle between the bend in the burrow and the perpendicular, theta. None of the nine dimensions of burrow architecture showed any difference between sexes. Six out of seven linear burrow dimensions differed significantly among crabs in the three size classes recognized; BNH did not differ among small, medium, and large-sized crabs. Regardless of species, larger-sized crabs dug larger entrances and resided in more voluminous burrows. The architecture of the burrows in the two sympatric populations is rather similar: the only significant difference is that Uca vocans had wider BDs than U. annulipes. This could be due to the difference in carapace proportions of the two species: adult specimens of U. vocans have significantly larger carapace length to width ratios than those of U. annulipes. Comparisons of between the two species showed that the descent slopes of the burrows were similar, indicating that there is no evidence to suggest that burrows of fiddler crabs in sandy habitats have steeper descent slopes than those in muddy habitats. The mean volume of sediment excavated by U. vocans per m(2), though not significantly greater than that of U. annulipes, suggests that U vocans is potentially a more active agent of sediment re-working than its sympatric species in this lagoon.

AB  - Nine burrow-morphological characters (burrow diameter, BD; burrow volume, BV; total burrow depth, TBD; burrow neck height, BNH; curved burrow length, CBL; horizontal length, HL; chamber diameter, CD; angle between descending neck of burrow and the substrate surface, beta; angle between the bend in the burrow and the perpendicular, theta) were defined from a study of 127 complete burrow casts of the fiddler crab, Uca annulipes. Crabs in 14 one-m(2) quadrats randomly sited in low, mid, and high shore levels on a lagoonal beach were sexed and categorized into small, medium, and large size-classes. Sediment type in each quadrat was assessed as anoxic or non-anoxic. Density was estimated at 12.8 crabs m(-2); mean sex ratio was 2.75 male:1 female. Five burrow-morphological characters (BV, TBD, BNH, CBL, and CD) differed significantly between sexes, being larger in male than in female crab burrows (p < 0.05). Differences in these burrow characters were indicative that males excavated larger burrows than females. Burrow mid-angle was significantly more obtuse in female crab burrows (p < 0.05), indicative of a more gradual turn in the descent of the burrows made by males. We attributed this to the poorer manoeuvrability of the males in the burrows due to their large chelipeds. Burrows of larger-sized crabs had greater BD, larger BV, and bigger CD than burrows of small- and medium-sized crabs. Significantly deeper burrows were dug at the high shore level than at both mid- and lower shore regions. We hypothesize that digging deeper burrows in the high intertidal is one way in which the fiddler crab can maintain lower burrow temperatures when the tide recedes. Burrows in anoxic sediments had significantly shorter TBD, BNH, and CBL than burrows in non-anoxic sediments. We postulate that shorter burrows in anoxic sediments may help improve the aeration of the burrows as opposed to longer burrows that accumulate a greater amount of stagnant air.

AB  - Density and burrow morphology of Uca annulipes were studied at three micro-habitats in a Singapore mangrove. The three micro-habitats were: areas dominated by overhanging prop roots (AR), areas with pneumatophores and underlying cable roots (UR),, and areas of bare substratum (NR). Nine, eleven, and ten 0.25 m(2) quadrats were established. randomly in the AR, UR, and NR habitats, respectively. Sex and size-class of crabs in the quadrats were recorded. Nine burrow morphology dimensions were measured using wax casts of 135 burrows. AR and UR habitats with mean crab densities of 24.0 +/- 9.8 and 25.5 +/- 6.5 crabs m(-2), had significantly more crabs than the NR habitat (7.6 +/- 45.1 crabs m(-2)). We propose that perhaps more, crabs inhabit these two habitats as (1) there is less burrow maintenance cost due to increased substratum stability rendered by the pneumatophores, cable roots, algal mats, and mussel beds; (2) there is more food (i.e., organic matter) present; (3) there could be more refuge from predators. NR and AR habitats' burrow volumes were both smaller than that measured for the UR habitat, indicating that U. annulipes were more active bioturbators in the areas where there are pneumatophores and underlying cable roots than in the sandy areas around the trees. MANOVA results of the six linear burrow variables, crossed with habitat, sex, and size of crabs, showed that male and female crabs excavated burrows that were similar in morphology. Larger-sized crabs excavated larger burrows than smaller crabs. Habitat type affected the size of the chamber diameter in which crabs spend time underground when the tide comes in. Burrow ground-angle (beta) and mid-angle (theta) of males and females were similar; beta (for combined data) did not differ significantly in the three micro-habitats. The theta of NR was larger than that of UR and AR. We speculate that burrows with a greater theta could aid in the survival of the crabs, as more acutely bent burrows provide better refuge from predators, especially in "open" areas such as the NR habitat.

AB  - Maxilliped-setation in two Australian fiddler crabs, Uca perplexa (n = 104) and U. vomeris (n = 128) was studied and related to the habitats in which these crabs live. Both species were collected from the banks of Myora Springs, North Stradbroke Island, Queensland, Australia. We counted the total number of setae (both plumose and spoon-tipped) on: 1) the inner and outer surfaces of the first and second maxillipeds, and 2) the inner surface of the third maxilliped. In general, there is no distinct sexual dimorphism for both types of setae in the two species. For any given size of crab, significantly more spoon-tipped setae were present in U. perplexa than in U. vomeris, providing further quantitative evidence that fiddler crabs from sandy habitats possess more spoon-tipped setae (an adaptation for processing sandy sediments) than those living in muddy habitats. No significant difference in plumose setation between the two species was generally detected; perhaps plumose setation is of less adaptive significance in terms of habitat adaptation than spoon-tipped setation in these two species. There is generally no sexual dimorphism in the size of the three maxillipeds for both species. Uca perplexa males had longer minor chelipeds than females while U. vomeris males had minor chelipeds that are deeper in the centre than females. These results provide evidence that male fiddler crabs could compensate for their foraging handicap by having longer or deeper minor chelipeds which enable them to scoop larger amounts of substrate.

AB  - Density and distribution patterns of two species of fiddler crabs, Uca annulipes (H. Milne Edwards, 1837) and U. vocans (Linnaeus, 1758) were studied on Pulau [=Island] Hantu Besar, Singapore. Twenty-five and 26 1m(2) quadrats were sampled at the upper and lower shore levels of the lagoonal beach. Sediment samples from each quadrat were analysed for %sand, %mud and %organic content. A two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) of crab density against species and shore level position showed the interaction term, 'Species x Shore level' to be significant (p < 0.05), with Uca annulipes being more abundant on the upper shore and U. vocans preferring the lower shore. A General Linear Model for Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA) was used to further analyze the biotope-related variables (sand, mud and organic content) against crab species and shore level position. This time 'Species x Shore level' interaction was not significant (p > 0.05). After this interaction term was removed from the model, only the main factor, 'Species', was significant (p < 0.05). Subsequent ANOVAs showed U. annulipes was significantly (p < 0.05) associated with sediments containing higher sand content regardless of shore level, and U. vocans was significantly (p < 0.05) associated with sediments that had higher mud content. These results provide quantitative data to support and explain qualitative observations that U. annulipes are generally found in sandier habitats than U. vocans.

AB  - time taken to traverse a set length of artificial burrows, was studied. For both species, 13 male (M) and 13 female (F) crabs of three size classes (small [S], medium [M], and large [L] were tested for running speeds along the burrows with three different angles of inclination, 0 (U. annulipes (High: 70 degrees; Mid: 50 degrees; Low: 30 degrees]; U. vocans [High: 80 degrees; Mid: 55 degrees; Low: 30 degrees]) (n = 156 crabs). An analysis of variance for repeated measures on run times against sex-size class grouping and 0 showed that the interaction term, 'Sex-size class x theta' was significant for U. annulipes, but not significant for U. vocans. Generally, for all sex-size class combinations, U. annulipes ran faster in 30 degrees-burrows than those in 50 degrees-burrows; they were, in turn, faster than those in 70 degrees-burrows. Sex and size of crabs did not affect run times appreciably in 30 degrees-burrows. In 70 degrees-burrows, L-sized crabs were faster than M-sized crabs which were in turn faster than S-sized crabs, regardless of sex. This trend was less evident when theta = 50 degrees. For U. vocans, both factors, sex-size class combinations, and 0, significantly affected run-times. Manoeuvrability of L-sized crabs (regardless of sex), did not differ significantly from female M-sized crabs but L-sized crabs are significantly faster than M-sized mates and S-sized crabs (regardless of sex), probably due to advantages derived from larger physical size (i.e., FL < ML < FM < MM < FS < MS). Running speeds of crabs, regardless of sex-size class combinations, increase significantly as 0 decreases, indicating that burrows with greater mid-angles are more restrictive to crab in-burrow movement (run time(30 degrees) < run time(55 degrees) < run time(80 degrees).).

AB  - Multivariate Analyses of Variance of six linear burrow morphology variables belonging to a common Indo-West Pacific fiddler crab, Uca annulipes, showed that there were significant differences in burrow morphology in bare, as compared to pneumatophore-dominated habitats. This was demonstrated both in the field as well as in simulated mangrove micro-habitats in the laboratory. Under field conditions, only burrow neck height differed significantly between the burrows excavated in the two micro-habitats: significantly longer burrow neck heights were observed in bare habitats, which may provide a better refuge from predators. Burrows excavated under simulated conditions, had significantly longer curved burrow lengths and horizontal lengths in bare habitats than in pneumatophore-dominated habitats. It is probably easier for the crabs to excavate longer burrows (= better refuge) in bare habitats than in areas with hard structures like upright pneumatophores. Burrows in bare habitats, both in the field and in the simulated habitats, bent significantly more at the mid-angle than those excavated in pneumatophore-dominated habitats. This is probably due to pneumatophores impeding the crabs' excavation activities. In the simulated habitats, burrows were excavated significantly nearer to the artificial pneumatophores and/or to the edge of the enclosure in the pneumatophore-dominated habitat than in the bare habitat. This observation provides evidence that fiddler crabs preferentially excavate burrows in close proximity to hard structural elements.

AB  - Burrow fidelity of a droving species, Uca vocans was compared with that of its sympatric associate, U. annulipes, a non-droving species. Crab re-emergence rate (RR) and burrow residency duration (BRD) were recorded for four to six consecutive days over six sampling periods from May to July 2006 at a lagoon beach at Pulau Hantu Besar, Singapore. The number of times that U. vocans and U. annulipes were tracked in the field was 327 and 306, respectively. Surface sediment was sampled in areas of high and low incidences of burrow abandonment. Marked crabs were similarly tracked in an ex situ study for 10 consecutive days. RR (field data) was significantly higher (i) in U. annulipes than in U. vocans (69.1 +/- 2.7% > 57.7 +/- 3.1%) and (ii) on sunny days than on overcast days (66.7 +/- 2.5% > 55.0 +/- 3.4%) in main effects' analyses (Two-way ANOVA). Similarly, BRD (field data) was significantly greater in (i) U. annulipes than in U. vocans (3.92 +/- 0.08 days > 3.54 +/- 0.09 days) and (ii) males than in females (3.83 +/- 0.08 days > 3.59 +/- 0.10 days). Both species had the largest frequency of crabs that resided in the same burrow for four days. In both the field and ex situ studies, U. vocans was observed to abandon burrows more frequently than U. annulipes although not on a daily basis. Organic content in high and low crab spatial movement areas did not differ significantly, suggesting that burrow abandonment is likely not related to food availability. Thus, U. vocans, although well-documented as a 'droving' species, exhibits considerable burrow fidelity at Pulau Hantu Besar, Singapore.

AB  - This study aims to give an integrative description of the correlation of physiological parameters of osmoregulation and the habitats of the four common Uca species in Taiwan. Uca arcuata inhabits areas close to fresh water in the upper beach. Uca formosensis is only found in the areas near the mean high water of spring tide where there is a clear dry-wet transition within a single semilunar cycle. Uca vocans is found in the lower intertidal zone. Uca lactea, the most widely distributed species, can easily be found on most muddy sand shores. The number of gills was observed and histological sectioning performed on each species. The range of salinity in which the fiddler crabs maintained their hemolymph osmolality without any significant change (i.e. osmoregulatory homeostasis) and the gill Na+, K+-ATPase activity were determined by transferring individuals to different salinity tanks. The results suggest that U. formosensis and U. lactea can sustain a wider range of salinity change through both modification in gill morphology and Na+, K+-ATPase activity. Uca arcuata can regulate in a hypo-osmotic condition and U. vocans tends to be a weak- osmoregulator.

AB  - Among the proposed functions of carotenoids in aquaculture have been those of pigmentation, antioxidant functions, as a source of pro-vitamin A, cellular protection from photodynamic damage, enhancement of growth and reproductive potential. However results reported by various authors are often contradictory. Some evidence suggests that these pigments may perform vital roles in growth and reproductive success in Crustaceans. Additional efforts need to be devoted to the understanding of the active forms of the carotenoid derived metabolites, retinoids in crustaceans. Dietary carotenoids are the sole biological precursors of retinoids in crustaceans. The importance of carotenoids as bioactive molecules reside to a large degree on their conversion to retinoids that are involved in the activation of hormonal nuclear receptors. Retinoids play a prominent role in many developmental processes, including embryonic development and differentiation of various cell types. The presence of receptors of retinoic acid in crustaceans and our findings of retinoids in the neuroendocrine complex and in reproductive tissue, as well as the enhancement of the ovarian development in shrimp suggests an important role of these metabolites in shrimp physiology for their successful aquaculture.

There are some hypotheses and the cause of the malformation remains unknown, but the results are indicative that is most likely due to errors in morphogenetic processes.

AB  - Callinectes sapidus and Uca spp. megalopae were sampled extensively during September 1985 and August to October 1986 in a secondary estuary near the mouth of Delaware Bay, USA. Collections taken every 2 h over as many as 12 consecutive tidal cycles indicate that megalopae of both species were significantly more abundant in the water column during flood than ebb tides, and that maximum abundance occurred during nocturnal flood tides. This pattern of abundance provides a mechanism for upstream transport of megalopae by flooding tidal currents. Seasonal peaks in abundance of megalopae corresponded to periods in coastal set-up; this suggests that megalopae are dependant on wind-driven exchange for transport into the estuary from the adjacent continental shelf. The coincidence of wind events resulting in coastal set-up with the occurrence of patches of megalopae near the mouths of estuaries may be responsible for much of the inter- and intra-annual variation in recruitment in these taxa.

AB  - Uca annulipes (H. Milne Edwards) is the dominant fiddler crab inhabiting mangrove forests in East Africa. However, several aspects concerning its reproduction are poorly known. Such information is necessary for a better understanding of several biological aspects occurring in this species. The aim of this study was to assess the reproductive biology of Uca annulipes as well as some factors determining its breeding season. Samplings were undertaken from January to December 2002 at Costa do Sol, a tropical mangrove forest around Maputo Bay, southern Mozambique. Crabs were randomly sampled, measured for carapace width (CW) and checked for the presence of eggs on female pleopods. Like most tropical brachyurans, Uca annulipes follows a continuous reproduction throughout the year with peaks of spawning during summer season and low frequency of egg-bearing females during winter. The frequency of ovigerous females was correlated with the air temperature (r(2) = 0.652, p < 0.05) and rainfall (r(2) = 0.897, p < 0.001), with the last parameter being the most important factor regulating the reproductive activity of this crab.

AB  - Uca inversa is one of the most abundant brachyuran crabs found in East African mangrove forests. However, several aspects concerning its reproduction are scarcely known. In this study, the breeding biology of U. inversa is described by analysing the monthly occurrence of ovigerous females as well as the effects of temperature and rainfall on breeding periodicity. Samples were randomly taken from January to December 2002 at Costa do Sol mangrove, Maputo Bay, southern Mozambique. U. inversa exhibits a continuous reproduction with two peaks of spawning (December and March). Linear regressions showed that both temperature and rainfall were positively associated with the frequency of ovigerous females. Multiple regression analysis suggests that temperature is the main factor governing the breeding biology of U. inversa in the study area.

AB  - Uca annulipes (H. Milne Edwards, 1837) is probably the most abundant brachyuran crab inhabiting mangrove forests in East Africa. However, its fecundity is poorly understood. Crabs were randomly sampled during spring low tides from January to April 2002 at Costa do Sol mangrove, Maputo Bay, southern Mozambique. Carapace width (CW), abdomen width (AW), weight (W) and egg numbers (EN) were recorded. The average fecundity was 1599 ± 842 eggs, ranging from 529 (CW = 5.0 mm) to 4250 (CW = 24.1 mm) eggs respectively. Egg number increased significantly with increase in crab size. This information contributes to our knowledge of the reproductive potential and the reproductive processes occurring in this species of crab.

AB  - The community structure of the tropical fiddler crab Uca annulipes (H. Milne Edwards) has been studied in Mozambique for the first time. Ten 0.25 m(2) squares were randomly sampled on a monthly basis during low tide periods from January to December 2002 at Costa do Sol Mangrove, Maputo Bay., southern Mozambique. A total of 981 crabs were captured. of which 494 were males (50.36%) 231 non-ovigerous females (23.85%) and 253 ovigerous females (25.79%). The overall size frequency distribution was unimodal, with males being largest than both ovigerous and non-ovigerous females. Females were more abundant in the smallest size classes while males outnumbered females in the largest ones. The overall sex ratio (1:0.99) did not differ from the expected 1:1 proportion, but significant deviations were observed in January. April, August and November. Results indicate that the size frequency distributions of this species can also be determined through direct analysis of burrow openings. Breeding took place year-round with two peaks of spawning in summer (January and December). Recruits were present throughout the year, with high abundance in summer probably due to the high reproductive activity observed in this season. The present results may allow us to suggest that U. annulipes follows a rapid breeding cycle accompanied by a rapid larval development and settlement in the study area.

AB  - Although fiddler crabs are among the main faunal components in mangrove habitats, few studies have described the population structure and reproduction of tropical species. Such information is important for understanding their life cycle and ecology. In this study, the population structure and reproduction of Uca urvillei were studied at Costa do Sol, a tropical mangrove forest in Maputo Bay, southern Mozambique. Ten 1.0-m(2) squares were sampled during low tide periods, between January and December 2003. The population is characterized by normal size distributions, which are slightly skewed to the left. Males on average are larger than females. Males were more abundant than females and the monthly sex ratios were male-biased. Juveniles were found year-round but were less common in June and December. Both gonadosomatic index and frequency of ovigerous females showed that Uca urvillei breeds continuously with peaks in summer and a strong decrease in winter. Egg number was proportional to female size.

AB  - The population structure and reproductive biology of Uca inversa (Hoffman) were studied in Mozambique for the first time. Crabs were randomly sampled on monthly basis during low tide periods from January to December 2002 at Costa do Sol mangrove, Maputo Bay, southern Mozambique. A total of 1131 crabs was obtained, of which 518 (45.8%) were males, 322 non-ovigerous females (29.3%) and 281 (24.8%) ovigerous females, respectively. The present population presents non-normal size frequency distributions, with males reaching greater size than females. The overall sex ratio (M:F) (1:0.84) was significantly different from the 1: 1 ratio. Ovigerous females were present throughout the year and the embryonic development showed synchrony with the gonadosomatic index, in which females carrying eggs close to hatching were more abundant when the gonadosomatic index reached minimum values in the population. Egg number increases with female size. Juvenile recruitment was also continuous with high proportion of young recruits being recorded in winter, probably due to the high reproductive activity displayed in summer. U. inversa exhibits a rapid embryonic cycle accompanied by a rapid larval development and settlement in the study area. (C) 2004 Elsevier SAS. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study aimed to assess the population biology and reproduction of the fiddler crab Uca chlorophthalmus at its limit of geographical distribution, Saco da Inhaca mangrove, southern Mozambique. Monthly samples were conducted at low tide periods between January and December 2003. The size distributions showed uni- and bimodal patterns, with males reaching larger sizes than ovigerous and non-ovigerous females. Females were slightly more abundant than males, but the overall sex ratio (1:1.01) did not differ significantly from 1:1. Uca chlorophthalmus displays continuous reproductive patterns with peaks of breeding in March and December. Moreover, linear correlations revealed that breeding in this crab is controlled by both temperature and rainfall. Similarly, juvenile recruitment was constant, but was more intense in winter (May-July). Brood size was positively associated with female size. Timing of the observed breeding pattern in the study area may enhance reproductive output and recruitment of the species.

AB  - It has been known that factors, so-called mandibular organ inhibiting hormones (MOIH), from the crustacean sinus gland (SG) inhibit the production of juvenile hormone-like compound, methylfarnesoate from the mandibular organ (MO). These factors were isolated and characterized. Their functions other than MO inhibition were also investigated. Studies on a newly discovered neuropeptide family from SG using an in vitro MO bioassay on the crayfish Procambarus indicated that MOIHs are members of this neuropeptide family, which includes crustacean hyperglycemic hormone (CHH), molting inhibiting hormone (MIH) and vitellogenesis inhibiting hormone (VIH). Using two-step reverse phase HPLC, three peptides with MOIH activity, namely P21, P22, and P25 were isolated and purified from the spider crab Libinia emarginata. SDS-PAGE showed that all three peptides had the same molecular weight. The Molecular mass was determined to be 8,439 for P25, 8,474 for P22, and 8,398 for P21 by mass spectrometry. All three peptides have similar amino acid compositions and contain 72-76 residues. These MOIHs caused significant hyperglycemia when injected into the fiddler crab Uca pugilator. The primary structure of MOIH P22 has been determined. It has 72 amino acid residues (deduced molecular mass 8490.5 Da) with pyroglutamic acid at the N-terminus and NH$\sb2$ at the C-terminus. It shares a high percentage of sequence identity with other members of the aforementioned CHH neuropeptides family. A cDNA library was constructed using enriched polyA(+) RNA from the eyestalks of the crab Libinia emarginata and lZiplox cDNA cloning system (BRL). A 137 bp probe was generated by RT-PCR using degenerated primers derived from the amino acid sequence of the MOIH. Screening of 500,000 clones from the cDNA library with the 137 bp probe resulted in six positive clones. One of the positive clones contained a full length cDNA sequence of 972 bp encoding the MOIH P22. This cDNA sequence encodes a preprohormone peptide with 137 amino acid residues, including a 26-amino acid long signal peptide, a 34-amino acid long precursor peptide, a dibasic peptide, the full length of 72-amino acid long MOIH P22, and a tri-peptide Gly-Lys-Lys which designates the potential amidation site at the C-terminus of the mature peptide.

AB  - Using two-step reverse phase HPLC, we isolated and purified three peptides with mandibular organ inhibiting hormone (MO-IH) activity from the spider crab Libinia emarginata. One of the peptides, P22, gave a yield of 355 ng/SG. The others gave lower yields: P21, 9 ng/SG; P25, 67.5 ng/SG. The molecular weight was determined to be 8,439 for P25, 8,474 for P22, and 8,398 for P21 by mass spectrometry. All three peptides have similar amino acid compositions and contain 72-76 residues. We believe these peptides to be different isoforms of one family. The MO is more sensitive to the two minor isoforms, P21 and P25. All three isoforms can inhibit MO activity to a maximum inhibition of 70%. All three isoforms gave a significant hyperglycemic effect when injected into de-eyestalked fiddler crabs Uca pugilator. We believe the MO-IHs to be members of the crustacean hyperglycemic hormone (CHH) family, having similar amino acid compositions and both biological activities.

AB  - Most insects and decapod crustaceans possess an assemblage of midline neuropils, the central complex. Recent phylogenetic studies show a sister-goup relationship between hexapods and decapods, suggesting that central complexes in both groups are homologous structures derived from a basal ancestral neuropil (22). This ancestral archetype of the central complex (lacking the protocerebral bridge) might be represented in the chilopods. Until recently, diplopods were regarded as closely related to chilopods and united within the taxon "Myriapoda". The entire lack of a midline neuropil in diplopods, however, renders the monophyletic origin of the class Myriapoda unlikely (15). In this study we used a palette of immunocytochemical and neuroanatomical methods to investigate mid-line neuropils in hitherto poorly examined arthropod groups. Of special interest for resolving arthropod phylogeny are onychophorans, who are believed to be an evolutionary ancient group that resembles the ancestors of modem arthropods. Striking similarities in central brain neuroarchitecture of the onychophoran Euperipatoides rowellii and of a chelicerate species, however, suggest a close phylogenetic relationship between these two groups. Our findings imply that onychophorans either represent the oldest form of the chelicerates or that extant onychophorans have developed from chelicerate-like ancestors by neoteny.

AB  - Anthropogenic habitat fragmentation is increasingly problematic in both terrestrial and aquatic systems. Fragmentation reduces the size of habitat patches, so examining the effect of patch size on community structure can provide insight into the potential effects of fragmentation. In this study, we examined the effect of habitat size on the density of Spartina alterniflora shoots in tidal saltwater marshes, as well as on the two predominant macrofaunal species, the marsh periwinkle Littoraria irrorata and fiddler crabs Uca spp. We estimated the density of shoots in three different marsh habitats, (1) large island marshes, (2) small island marshes, and (3) large fringing marshes, in Indian Field Creek, York River, Chesapeake Bay. We manipulated shoot density in each of the marsh types to distinguish between the effects of marsh grass density and marsh type on crab and Littoraria densities in the system. We found significant differences in grass density among the three marsh types as well as significant species-specific effects of grass density, marsh type, and distance from edge on faunal abundance. Decreasing the shoot density resulted in a decrease in Littoraria density in the large marshes. Littoraria density increased with distance from edge in the small marshes and in the first 5 m of the fringing marshes, then decreased with distance from edge after 5 in in the fringing marshes. Shoot density had a negative effect on crabs in both the large and small marshes. These results suggest that fragmentation would have a negative effect on the community structure by lowering the densities of both the flora and fauna. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Persistence of many estuarine organisms depends upon the successful transport of larvae from adult areas in estuaries to coastal waters for development. This process is often facilitated by a behavioral mechanism, referred to as selective tidal-stream transport (STST), in which larvae migrate toward the surface, are transported seaward during ebb tides, and return to the bottom during flood tides. Previous studies indicate that that fiddler crab Uca pugilator zoea-1 larvae use selective STST to migrate from adult habitats to shelf waters. In areas with semidiumal tides, this behavior is mediated by a circatidal rhythm with a period of [approximate]12.4 h. The first series of experiments tested the hypothesis that U. pugilator zoeae from different tidal regimes possess activity rhythms that match local tidal patterns. Ovigerous crabs were collected from areas with semidiumal, diurnal, and mixed tides and from an area within a microtidal coastal lagoon. Differences in larval activity patterns suggest that STST behaviors are controlled by separate circatidal and circalunidian clocks or paired circalunidian clocks coupled in antiphase. The second series of experiments tested the hypothesis that the period and phase of the rhythm exhibited by U. pugilator zoeae is phenotypically plastic and entrained in embryos prior to hatching. Results suggest that the period and phase of the circatidal rhythms exhibited by U. pugilator zoeae are not influenced by environmental conditions prior to hatching, but instead are the result of some unknown interaction or communication between the female and embryo during brooding. As with U. pugilator, larvae of the fiddler crab Uca minax are exported from adult habitats in estuaries to coastal and shelf waters where they undergo development prior to re-entering estuaries as postlarvae (megalopae). Studies of the spatial distribution of both newly hatched zoeae (Stage I) and megalopae suggest they undergo rhythmic vertical migrations associated with the tides for unidirectional transport. The third series of experiments tested the hypothesis that U. minax zoeae possess a circatidal rhythm in vertical migration that facilitates offshore transport in ebb tidal flows, while postlarvae (megalopae) return to estuaries using a similar flood-phased endogenous rhythm. Results indicate that circatidal rhythm forms the behavioral basis of STST in early stage zoeae, but does not undergo a sufficient phase-shift to account for spatial (vertical) distribution patterns exhibited by megalopae in the field. The biogeographic distribution of the genus Uca includes both estuarine and coastal species that are often spatially separated along salinity gradients. Thus, the adaptive value of STST behaviors for enhancing export likely varies among species. The final series of experiments tested the hypothesis that the expression of a circatidal migration rhythm in Uca is associated with the location of the adult habitat relative to coastal development areas. Results are consistent with predictions based on species-specific differences in the proximity of hatching areas to the mouths of estuaries, and suggest that STST behaviors may have arisen in association with adaptations for estuarine living.

AB  - The genus Uca (fiddler crabs) includes both estuarine and coastal species, the zoeae of which must travel varying distances to reach the sea. Rapid seaward transport following hatching may be facilitated by tidal currents through an ebb-phased circatidal rhythm in vertical swimming by larvae. Assuming there is a cost to vertical swimming, we predicted that endogenous swimming rhythms would be stronger in zoeae of species that live far up estuaries (oligohaline and mesohaline areas) and weaker or absent in coastal species and that adult ecology, not phylogeny, would best explain interspecific variation in vertical swimming rhythms. Both predictions were confirmed. Ovigerous females of 15 Uca species in 4 subgenera were collected from 10 locations along the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts of the United States and the Pacific and Caribbean coasts of Panama. Swimming activity of zoeae-1 larvae was recorded under constant conditions for 72 h. Regardless of subgenus, estuarine species exhibited ebb-phased circatidal swimming rhythms that persisted for several cycles and matched the tidal patterns at the collection sites, while the swimming of coastal species was arrhythmic. Species-specific differences in the proximity of adult habitats and hatching areas to the sea accounted for differences in larval behavior that promotes seaward transport. Vertical swimming rhythms of larvae may have evolved together with other traits that permit estuarine living.

AB  - Larvae of the fiddler crab Uca pugilator are released near the time of high tide and are exported to shelf waters to undergo development. Previous studies indicate that newly hatched zoeae use selective tidal-stream transport (STST) to migrate from estuaries to coastal areas. In areas with semi-diurnal tides, the STST behavior of larvae is mediated by a circatidal activity rhythm that is characterized by upward vertical migration into the water column during ebb tide followed by a descent toward the bottom during flood tide. We tested the hypothesis that U. pugilator zoeae from different tidal regimes possess endogenous activity rhythms that match local tidal patterns. Ovigerous crabs with late-stage embryos were collected from locations lacking tides (microtidal) and from areas with diurnal and mixed tides. Following hatching, larvae were placed in constant conditions and swimming activity was monitored continuously for 96 h. Zoeae from the diurnal regime exhibited a rhythm with a periodicity of ≈24.2 h, consistent with the tides at the collection site. Crabs from areas with mixed tides displayed activity rhythms with two dominant periodicities at 12.6 h and 23.5 h, reflecting the main semi-diurnal and diurnal components of this tidal pattern. At both locations, peaks in larval activity occurred during the time of expected ebb currents, which is consistent with STST behavior favoring seaward transport (i.e., ebb-tide transport). Finally, zoeae from microtidal areas exhibited circatidal rhythms similar to those observed in crabs from areas with semi-diurnal tides. Differences in the activity patterns of zoeae from the three tidal regimes suggest that STST behaviors are controlled by multiple endogenous clocks or multiple couplers linked to a single clock.

AB  - Larvae of the blue crab Callinectes sapidus and fiddler crab Uca pugilator are exported from estuaries and develop on the continental shelf. Previous studies have shown that the zoea-1 larvae of some crab species use selective tidal-stream transport (STST) to migrate from estuaries to coastal areas. The STST behavior of newly hatched larvae is characterized by upward vertical migration during ebb tide followed by a descent toward the bottom during flood. The objectives of the study were (1) to determine if newly hatched zoeae of U. pugilator and C. sapidus possess endogenous tidal rhythms in vertical migration that could underlie STST, (2) to determine if the rhythms persist in the absence of estuarine chemical cues, and (3) to characterize the photoresponses of zoeae to assess the impact of light on swimming behavior and vertical distribution. Ovigerous crabs with late-stage embryos were collected from June to August 2002 and maintained under constant laboratory conditions. Following hatching, swimming activity of zoeae was monitored in darkness for 72 h. U. pugilator zoeae displayed a circatidal rhythm in swimming with peaks in activity occurring near the expected times of ebb currents in the field. Conversely, C. sapidus zoeae exhibited no clear rhythmic migration patterns. When placed in a light field that simulated the underwater angular light distribution, C. sapidus larvae displayed a weak positive phototaxis at the highest light levels tested, while U. pugilator zoeae were unresponsive. Swimming behaviors and photoresponses of both species were not significantly influenced by the presence of chemical cues associated with offshore or estuarine water. These results are consistent with predictions based on species-specific differences in spawning and the proximity of hatching areas to the mouths of estuaries. U. pugilator larvae are released within estuaries near the adult habitat. Thus, ebb-phased STST behavior by zoeae is adaptive since it enhances export. Selective pressures for a tidal migration in C. sapidus larvae are likely weaker than for U. pugilator since ovigerous females migrate seaward prior to spawning and hatching occurs near inlets and in coastal waters.

AB  - Following hatching, larvae of the fiddler crab Uca minax (La Conte) are exported from the adult habitat in estuaries to coastal and shelf waters where they undergo development prior to re-entering estuaries as postlarvae (megalopae). Studies of the spatial distribution of both newly hatched zoeae (Stage 1) and megalopae indicate they undergo rhythmic vertical migrations associated with the tides for dispersal and unidirectional transport (selective tidal-stream transport) both within estuaries and between estuaries and the nearshore coastal ocean. We tested the hypothesis that U. minax zoeae possess a circatidal rhythm in vertical migration that facilitates offshore transport in ebb tidal flows, while postlarvae (megalopae) return to estuaries using a similar flood-phased endogenous rhythm. We also determined if the expression of the rhythm was influenced by the salinity conditions zoeae and megalopae experience as they transition between low-salinity regions of estuaries and high-salinity coastal waters. Stage I zoeae were collected by holding ovigerous female crabs in the lab until hatching. Megalopae were collected from the plankton and identified to species using molecular techniques (PCR-RFLP). Under constant laboratory conditions, both zoeae and megalopae exhibited endogenous circatidal rhythms in swimming that matched the principal harmonic constituent of the local tides (12.39 +/- 0.07 h;(X) over bar +/- SE). Upward swimming in Stage I zoeae occurred 2.5-4 h after high tide near the time of expected maximum ebb currents in the field. Rhythmic swimming of megalopae occurred slightly earlier in the tide (2.5 +/- 0.09 h after high tide; (X) over bar +/- SE) but was not entirely synchronized with flood currents, as expected. Salinity conditions had no apparent effect on the expression or pattern of the rhythms. Results indicate that this circatidal rhythm forms the behavioral basis of selective tidal-stream transport (STST) in early stage U. minax zoeae, but does not undergo a sufficient phase shift to account for vertical distribution patterns exhibited by megalopae in the field.

AB  - Populations and therefore communities of intestinal helminths of vertebrates are fueled by recruitment of new individuals from outside the host. The source of new individuals is often an intermediate host that harbors several infective propagules of 1 or more species. Hence these source communities are transmitted in packets of infective propagules to target communities in definitive hosts. Packets not only provide recruits to target communities, but, because a packet of propagules possesses its own structure, it may also transmit structure to the target community. We use this system to examine the contribution that structure in the source pool of propagules makes to the structure of recruitment-driven target populations and communities. By treating the dynamics of such target populations and communities as immigration-death processes, we conclude: (1) Unlike a birth-driven population a recruitment-driven target population will grow to an asymptotic limit even in the absence of density-dependent processes or reaching carrying capacity; (2) the frequency distribution of the number of recruits entering target populations will determine the frequency distribution of adults in target populations; (3) interspecific associations among species in the source community will be transmitted to target communities, but the magnitude of the transmitted associations will depend upon the relative survival rates of the species; and (4) for associations of equal magnitude in a source community, the magnitude of a transferred negative association will be less than the magnitude of a positive association in a target community. Two examples of source communities in salt marsh crabs reveal that source infracommunities exist with the hypothesized structure. Further, the source helminth communities display a greater number of positive than negative interspecific associations.

AB  - Uca tangeri (Eydoux, 1835) is the only species of fiddler crab that occurs in Portugal, where it mainly inhabits salt marshes in the south and southwest coasts. Individuals spend most of their rime on and around their galleries, bur rowing structures which they typically create and maintain in muddy substrate. Capturing fiddler crabs in nature is extremely difficult and can be destructive for their habitat. Once disturbed, U. tangeri tend to hide in their burrow, and their capture usually involves the destruction of the upper part of the burrow. In the present study, a method for estimating the carapace length of the fiddler indirectly, using the diameter of the burrow opening, is proposed. Significant sex-specific relationships between the diameter of the burrow opening and the occupant's length were found. Although the mean length of the carapace was not significantly different between sexes, males were found to be associated with smaller galleries, probably in order to prevent larger males entering their galleries.

AB  - Gill area (GA), proportion of ion-regulation and respiratory tissue surface, mean thickness of diffusion barrier epithelium plus cuticle and metabolic rate/gill area ratio (VO2/GA were measured in the intertidal fiddler crab Uca uruguayensis.

Mean GA was 351.56 mm(2) +/- 19.55, n = 18, 60% corresponding to ion-regulation tissue surface and 40% to respiratory area. Mean diffusion distance was 8.02 mu m ranging from 1.63 mu m at the fourth gill pair (fully respiratory) to 12.0 mu m for the seventh, ion-regulatory, gill pair. Cuticle thickness was 0.81 mu m in the lamellae of all the gills; a thicker cuticle was noted in the marginal channels (up to 10 mu m), that provide structural support to the gills.

VO2/GA was calculated for U. uruguayensis and compared with the same ratio for several species living in different habitats. This ratio increased with terrestrial tendencies, being sevenfold higher in terrestrial crabs than in aquatic and low tide ones. Air-active intertidal species, like U. uruguayensis showed intermediate values between those groups.

AB  - The posterior gills of Uca uruguayensis are mostly lined with a thick tissue which presents the characteristics of a typical salt-transporting epithelium. Electron microscope analysis of gill tissue from crabs acclimated to both low (2.5 parts per thousand) and high (44 parts per thousand) salinity showed significant development of the basolateral membrane interdigitations with numerous mitochondria and conspicuous apical membrane infoldings. In high-salinity acclimated crabs, the basolateral interdigitations extended to the apical membrane. Under these conditions, apical infoldings were expanded laterally (forming wide subcuticular spaces), while the apical infoldings of low-salinity adapted animals appeared as regular leaflets, Septate desmosomes were also much more developed in low-salinity exposed animals than in those kept under high-salinity conditions, These morphological observations were analyzed for correlation with the currently-accepted ion hyporegulation model for crustaceans, which is mainly based on transcellular sodium flow, In this study, we propose an ion hyporegulation model involving apical paracellular sodium flux.

AB  - [Leu]- and [Met]enkephalin from thoracic ganglia of the shore crab Carcinus maenas have been purified to homogeneity by a reversed-phase HPLC procedure. Automated gas-phase sequencing revealed a primary structure identical with that of enkephalins from vertebrates. The immunoreactive material in different parts of the nervous system of C. maenas was measured by RIA. Isolated crustacean [Leu]enkephalin shows physiological properties identical to synthetic [Leu]enkephalin in our bioassay. The enkephalinergic effect has been monitored by two bioassays: (i) inhibition of release of crustacean hyperglycemic hormone from isolated eyestalks of C. maenas, and (ii) decreased effect on blood glucose level in the fiddler crab Uca pugilator. The decrease in blood sugar level induced by [Leu]enkephalin was antagonized by naloxone, indicating a receptor-mediated process. In sequence analysis, the thoracic ganglion yielded 3 pmol of [Leu]enkephalin and almost-equal-to 1 pmol of [Met]enkephalin. The presence of enkephalins in crustaceans shows an earlier phylogenetic origin of opioids than presumed.

AB  - Autotomy of limbs has been observed for a variety of organisms and in some taxa has been shown to be an effective strategy for escaping predation. We investigated differences in the use of cheliped autotomy by small and largemale fiddler crabs during predation events, and also assessed if autotomy of the major cheliped allowed male fiddler crabs to escape predation more often than females. The blue crab Callinectes sapidus was presented with 5 small and 5 large male mud fiddler crabs Uca pugnax (n = 60), and in a second experiment, 5 male and 5 female U. pugnax were presented to C. sapidus (n = 60). Large U. pugnax autotomized their major cheliped more often and survived compared to small U. pugnax (n = 22 pools, S = 96.5, p < 0.0001), although this difference was not significant when adjusted for the total number of attacks on each size (n = 22 pools, S = 45, p = 0.1467). There was no significant difference (n = 29 pools, S = 30.5, p = 0.4988) between the total number of unsuccessful attacks on male versus female U. pugnax. At least half of the males autotomized their major cheliped in unsuccessful attacks during the first (69%) and second (53%) experiments. The major cheliped of male U. pugnax is a prominent visual stimulus that may have initially attracted C. sapidus to this prey; however, autotomization potentially enabled male fiddler crabs to escape predation in over half of all unsuccessful attacks.

AB  - The continuous excavation of burrows by fiddler crabs generates bioturbation in the sediment, which can be estimated from burrow morphology. The aim of the present study was to describe the burrow morphology of Uca uruguayensis and U. leptodactylus and its relationship with demography of resident individuals and to estimate the level of bioturbation in the sediment generated by each species. For all individuals from each of the 2 species, sex was determined and the carapace width (CW; mm) measured. Burrows were characterized according to burrow diameter (BD; mm), maximum burrow depth (MBD; mm) and burrow volume (BV; cm(3)). The density of each species in the study area was also evaluated. In both species, the males were larger and occupied burrows with higher BV compared to females. Differences between sexes in relation to the burrow characteristics might reflect sexual dimorphism within the group and are probably related to the fact that males use the burrows for mating. BD and BV showed significant positive relationships with the size of resident crabs. The amount of sediment removed per burrow was estimated from mean BV: 10.78 cm(3) of sediment/burrow for U. uruguayensis and 12.38 cm(3) of sediment/burrow for U. leptodactylus. Despite the density and depth differences between the 2 species, the similarity in burrow volume suggests that U. uruguayensis and U. leptodactylus present the same importance in terms of the bioturbation process. Burrow morphology is highly associated with characteristics of the occupant, although extrinsic factors should also be considered, and its description can provide estimates on the bioturbation generated by Uca species in mangrove forests.

AB  - Visual counts of surface-active crabs both by binocular and burrow counting methods have been used in many studies to estimate population density. However, their reliability has not yet been assessed comparatively. Three methods for estimating the abundance of fiddler crabs Uca annulipes in a mangrove forest (Inhaca Island, Mozambique) were compared from three different sub-areas: two sub-areas inundated only during spring tides and one sub-area inundated in both spring and neap tides. Burrow, binocular and direct (excavation) counting methods were performed by plotting ten 0.25 m(2) quadrats in each sub-area over the four moon phases. Overall densities (per 0.25 m(2)) differed according to method, sub-area and lunar phase. Burrow count overestimated crab density by up to 20%, while binocular count underestimated density by up to 41%. Correlation coefficient estimated for both counting methods showed that burrow count gives better density estimates than binocular count (0.91 and 0.56, respectively). Sex ratios were also investigated within the three sub-areas and at the moon phases. Males are dominant throughout the studied period except during new moon and first quarter, indicating that when the number of gravid females is low, sex ratio bias for binocular count is minimal.

AB  - The diversity, abundance, biomass and community structure of crustacean and molluscan macrofauna were studied in the Ranong mangrove forest ecosystem on the Andaman Sea coast of southern Thailand. After a history of commercial exploitation the mangroves along the Klong Ngao tidal creek have been assigned conservation status within a new Ranong Biosphere Reserve established in 1997. Over the past 12 years, several areas of mangrove destroyed or degraded by wood harvesting, tin mining and aquaculture, have been rehabilitated on a pilot basis by planting monocultures of mangrove seedlings using four common local species (Rhizophora apiculata, R. mucronata, Bruguiera cyclindrica and Ceriops tagal). These plantation forests with different past management histories were compared with a natural, mixed, mature mangrove forest which has been conserved for about 40 years. Macrofauna were sampled within a 100 m(2) vegetation quadrat in each study site. Crustaceans were sampled quantitatively by 3 x 15 min timed hand catches per site. Molluscs were sampled in 3 x m(2) quadrats positioned around three randomly selected trees in each vegetation quadrat. The lowest crustacean and molluscan diversity was recorded from the former tin mining site. The highest diversity was recorded from a Rhizophora plantation in the natural mixed forest area for both crustaceans and molluscs. The vegetation community structure was not correlated with the environmental variables measured, or with macrofauna community structure. Of the environmental parameters chosen, the crustacean community structure was best expressed by shore level, while for molluscan diversity and abundance it was soil moisture content. The macrofauna community structure at the tin mining site was significantly different to the other sites, and was dominated by a single species of crab, Metaplax elegans. Grapsid crabs, especially sesarmid species, dominated over ocypodid crabs in the mature forest site, whereas Uca species and other ocypodids were more abundant than grapsids in the degraded concession forest area. Snails of the families Neritidae and Ellobiidae were the most abundant molluscs in the mature forest, whereas Littoriinidae, Assimineidae and Potamidae species were more representative of the younger plantation sites. The findings from this study suggest that some of these well represented families of mangrove macrofauna could be used as indicators of ecological change as part of a long term environmental monitoring programme in Ranong and other areas in Southeast Asia where mangroves are being rehabilitated.

AB  - Uca pugilator hemocyanin is an exceptionally heterogeneous aggregate of different polypeptide chains. In a sample of < 100 individuals as many as nine different monomers were resolved. As reported by earlier workers, this protein is also exceptionally polymorphic. Only two of the nine chains in the present sample were invariant. Seven chains varied both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Five of the variable chains never reached the highest quantities attained by the other four. Phenotypes lacking one of the two variable chains that did reach maximal quantities, and/or one of the chains that reached intermediate quantities, were chosen for measurements of respiratory properties. The results strongly suggest that the more major of these two chains has a large influence on O2 affinity and a small influence on its pH dependence. Therefore, the structural polymorphism is accompanied by functional differences as well.

AB  - The monomeric subunit composition of the O-2 carrier hemocyanin was investigated in three pairs of sibling species in the fiddler crab genus Uca and a complex of two sibling species and their postulated hybrid in the stone crab genus Menippe. All but one species were polymorphic, thought to quite different degrees. None of the intraspecific variation resembled that expected of different gene products encoded at the same locals. Even when the intraspecific variation was great, however, the electrophoretic phenotype was absolutely, diagnostic of a species, suggesting that the crustacean hemocyanins diverged early in speciation. The hybrid stone crabs however, did not differ significantly from one of their parent species.

AB  - The monomeric subunit composition of fiddler crab hemocyanins was examined in four species, using native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The intraspecific variation was limited in Uca princeps monilifera and spinicarpa, but neither species was monomorphic. The variation was also smaller in U. crenulata coloradensis than found previously in U. pugilator. In U. musica musica, however, the variation was greater than in any other species examined thus far, regardless of family. In U. princeps monilifera and musica musica particular bands were invariably found together. In U. musica musica, the linked bands occupied very similar positions on the gels; they may represent similar polypeptides. In both species, the linked bands belonged to two mutually exclusive sets, one of which occurred more frequently than the alternative. In part because an intermediate condition was never observed, these phenotypes cannot be interpreted as products of different alleles encoded at the same locus. As in other crustaceans, the electrophoretic banding patterns were highly species specific and intraspecific variation did not produce phenotypes that could be confused with those of another species.

The oligomer composition of the hemocyanins of five species was examined by size-exclusion HPLC. In contrast to a previous report on a different member of the genus, the hemocyanins of all five assemble primarily to the 2 x 6-meric level, with the 1 x 6-meric fraction being minor.

AB  - The monomeric subunit composition of the oxygen carrier hemocyanin was examined in samples of the Sesarma reticulatum complex and of Uca minax, both of which are believed to be in the process of speciation. The samples were taken on the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico coasts, from disjunct populations that are believed to have been isolated by the Florida peninsula since the retreat of the last glacier. In Atlantic and Gulf samples of the S. reticulatum complex, which is believed to be in the terminal stages of speciation, the hemocyanins differed qualitatively. Several electrophoretic bands found in one group, including an invariant band, were totally absent from the other. This difference exceeds that reported in a previous investigation of a variety of polymorphic allozymes in this species complex. It also exceeds the physiologically labile differences in hemocyanins found previously within a panmictic species of brachyuran crustaceans. In U. minax, which is believed to have diverged less, Atlantic and Gulf animals expressed the same number of electrophoretic bands at exactly the same positions. Nonetheless, highly significant differences in band frequencies distinguished both Atlantic samples from the Gulf sample, and somewhat less significant differences distinguished the Atlantic cold temperate zone samples from the warm temperate zone ones. The phenotypes of the major bands, defined as those present in high densities, qualitatively distinguished Atlantic from Gulf animals, but they did not differentiate the two Atlantic samples. The difference between Atlantic and Gulf members of this species also exceeds that found previously among polymorphic allozymes. These findings further support the hypothesis that the hemocyanins are among the first proteins to diverge structurally in brachyuran speciation.

AB  - The West African marine brachyuran crab fauna, comprising 218 named species in 120 genera and 26 familes, is surveyed. Sixteen new genera and 24 new species are recognized. Synonymies are updated for the tropical species, and all 300+ Eastern Atlantic species are listed. Original references and synonymies are provided for all 146 Eastern Atlantic genera. Synonymies have been compiled for all 36 currently recognized families of marine crabs. Twenty-nine families are represented in the Eastern Atlantic fauna. One family, Hexapodidae Miers, 1886, and one subfamily, Camptandriinae Stimpson, 1858 (Ocypodidae) are revised at the generic level. The genera Liocarcinus Stimpson, 1871 (Portunidae), Machaerus Leach, 1818 (Goneplacidae), and Lambdophallus Alcock, 1900, Paeduma Rathbun, 1897, Parahexapus Balss, 1922, Pseudohexapus Monod, 1956, and Thaumastoplax Miers, 1881 (all Hexapodidae), are defined and recognized. It is suggested that the family Geryonidae Colosi, 1923, shows closest affinities with the family Portunidae Rafinesque, 1815.

AB  - The food web structure of a mangrove forest and adjacent seagrass beds in Gazi Bay, Kenya, was examined with stable carbon and nitrogen isotope ratio techniques. A carbon isotopic ratio gradient was found from mangroves with mean (+/-SD) delta(13)C value of -26.75 +/- 1.64 parts per thousand to seagrass beds with -16.23 +/- 4.35 parts per thousand. Seagrasses close to the mangroves were more depleted in C-13 than seagrasses close to the major coral reef. Macroinvertebrates collected along this mangrove seagrass bed transect showed a similar delta(13)C gradient. Fishes collected near the mangroves were depleted in C-13 compared to fishes collected in the seagrass meadows. The fish community was differentiated on the basis of its carbon isotopic ratios and the site where individuals were collected. Three groups were identified: (1) species occurring in seagrass meadows in the close vicinity of the mangrove swamps; (2) species migrating between mangroves and the seagrass meadows, together with species occurring throughout the entire seagrass area, from close to the mangroves to the outer bay; and (3) species that use the seagrass meadows proper as a lifetime habitat. The results show that seagrass stands are the main feeding grounds providing food for all fish species studied. delta(15)N signatures allowed to the identification of the following trophic levels: (1) fish species feeding on seagrasses and macroalgae (herbivores); (2) fish feeding on zoo/benthos-plankton (zoobenthiplanktivores); and (3) other fish and/or macro-crustacea (piscivores/benthivores). A N-15 isotepe enrichment of <2 parts per thousand was found between successive trophic levels suggesting significant omnivory.

AB  - From isolated sinus glands of Porcellio dilatatus, a hyperglycemic neuropeptide (CHH) was purified by means of a single, two-step purification procedure which consisted of gel chromatography on Sephadex G-50, followed by high-performance liquid chromatography. The 5800- to 6100-Da peptide contains 50–52 amino acid residues. The amino acid composition is (Pro, Ile)1; His1–2; (Thr, Ser, Gly, Met, Tyr)2; (Val, Phe, Lys)3; (Ala, Image, Leu, Arg)4; Glx5; Asx7; Trp, n.d. The amino acid composition differs from that of two decapod CHHs analyzed thus far. The N-terminus is blocked. The neuropeptide exhibits little or no interspecific hyperglycemic effect in the brachyuran, Uca pugilator, and its cross-reactivity and potency in the RIA for Carcinus-CHH is very low.

AB  - A study of the diet of nestlings and the overlap of trophic and spatial niches of sympatric Scarlet Ibis (Eudocimus ruber) and Yellow-crowned Night Heron (Nyctanassa violacea) in a northern Brazilian mangrove swamp was made from 1993 to 1997. A collection of regurgitates from nestlings was taken and stratified samples were taken at foraging areas. Both species fed mainly on saltwater ocypodid crabs, the night heron being more stenophagous than the ibis. About 90% of the prey of the night heron were Mangrove Land Crabs (Ucides cordatus) in the range 11-100 g, while fiddler crabs (Uca spp.) were 64% of the diet of ibises, being mostly in the range 1.1-10 g. The niche of the ibis was broader than that of the night heron, both in trophic and spatial dimensions. The distribution in foraging areas of the Yellow-crowned Night Heron showed a significant, positive spatial correlation with its main prey. The land crab formed a significantly greater proportion in the bird's diet than its relative abundance in the field. Scarlet This distribution showed no significant spatial correlation with its prey. The niche overlap of the two birds was only moderate, and they seemed to use adjacent regions of the ecological space. As Mangrove Land Crabs and fiddler crabs are similar, the main factor of prey segregation between the two bird species seemed to be prey size. In relation to other geographical areas, both Yellow-crowned Night Heron and Scarlet This occupied more restricted trophic niches, which may be related to the high availability of prey in northern Brazilian mangroves. Prey availability is more stable in saltwater ecosystems than in freshwater ones, so the high levels of niche overlap should not be attributed to seasonally relaxed competition. Competition does not seem to play a significant role in defining guild structure. It is not clear if the Scarlet This in Brazil suffers physiological constraints from dietary salt, as has been reported from North America.

AB  - A study on the temporal distribution, sex ratio, reproductive period, recruitment of juveniles and size composition of individuals of the fiddler crab Uca (Leptuca) uruguayensis was carried out in a population living in the Garças River mangrove, Guaratuba Bay, Paraná State, Brazil. Eight square samples of 0.25 m² (0.50 m side) were obtained on a monthly basis, from April/2011 to March/2012. The crabs were collected through the excavation of burrows and their carapace width (CW) was measured. Air and water temperatures varied from 19.0 to 29.5ºC and 17.0 to 27.0ºC, respectively, the salinity from 7 to 23 and the soil temperature from 19.0 to 29.2ºC. A total of 1,099 fiddler crabs were collected, being 529 males, 520 females (of these, 9 ovigerous) and 50 sexually undifferentiated individuals. The average density of the population ranged from 12 (June/11) to 71 ind.m-² (May/11), but its annual fluctuation was not correlated to abiotic variables. The sex ratio was 1:1 all year round and in all CW classes. Although in low abundance, ovigerous females were recorded in six months and juvenile crabs were present all year round, indicating a continuous reproduction and recruitment of the species. The CW of males ranged from 2.33 to 8.33 mm and that of females, from 2.52 to 7.79 mm: these data showed that this population is composed of smallest individuals among those studied

AB  - A study of the spatial distribution and abundance of fiddler crabs was carried out in Guaratuba Bay, Parana State, southern Brazil. Fiddler crabs were collected from 10 biotopes located along a salinity gradient from zero to 32 inside Guaratuba Bay (between 48 degrees 30 degrees W-25 degrees 50'S and 48 degrees 45'W-25 degrees 54'S). Seven species were found, among which, Uca mordax (Smith, 1870) occurred only in biotopes inundated by low salinity water, from zero to 16. Remaining species tolerated wide range of salinity oscillation, but Uca maracoani (Latreille, 1802-1803) and Uca leptodactyla Rathbun, 1898 predominated in saltier waters, from 14 to 32, while U. burgersi Holthuis, 1967, Uca rapax (Smith, 1870), Uca thayeri Rathbun, 1900, and Uca uruguayensis Nobili, 1901 were collected in more than three biotopes and showed to be euryhaline: they tolerated salinities from 4 to 32. However, other soil characteristics such as pebble/ sand/ silt/ clay balance, organic matter content and presence of seagrass also influenced the spatial distribution of these crabs. U. leptodactyla occurred with maximum density of 240 ind.m(-2), a highest recorded value.

AB  - Studies were carried out on the annual breeding period, lunar reproductive rhythm and daily activities rhythm of the western Atlantic fiddler crab Uca (Leptuca) leptodactyla Rathbun, 1898 from Guaratuba Bay, southern Brazil. This species reproduces from September to March, when ovigerous females are present and males construct their hoods. The monthly average air temperature fluctuates from 19.2 to 24.8 degrees C in this period. Hoods were constructed in accordance with the semilunar cycle of the breeding period; it lasted eight days, with the maximum frequency exactly on syzygy days (full or new moon). On a sunny full moon day in midsummer, males began to construct hoods 1.5 h after the substrate became exposed to the air, as the tide went out; the maximum density of hoods occurred after 3.5 h. The breeding patterns of most fiddler crabs of the world including U. leptodactyla are not determined by species-specific rules but by environmental conditions of the habitat, while other species respond in different manner to the same climatic conditions. Construction of hoods by males is a secure indication of the reproductive period of the fiddler crab U. leptodactyla from southern Brazil. The timing of hood construction within a day is similar to that in its consubgeneric species in spite of differences in local climatic conditions.

AB  - Allometric growth in the fiddler crab Uca mordox (Smith) (Crustacea, Decapoda, Ocypodidae) from Guaratuba Bay, Parana, Brazil. Relative growth of the male major chela and female abdomen was Studied in a population of the fiddler crab Uca mordax (Smith, 1870) from Guaratuba Bay, Parana, Southern Brazil. Major chela length (CMQ) was measured from 319 males, and abdomen width (LAB) from 356 females, Also six small sexually undifferentiated crabs were measured. Carapace width (LC) was the reference dimension for both sexes, which ranged from 1.94 to 20.0 mm for males, from 2.50 to 18.8S mm for females, and from 1.94 to 3.15 mm for sexually undifferentiated crabs. Relationship between LC and CMQ showed a transition point at 11.70 mm LC in males, and between LC and LAB, at 8.77 mm LC in females. Males (mean LC = 14.24 mm) showed a slightly greater size than females (mean LC = 13,97 mm). These dimensions had positive allometrical growth during all life for both sexes: before and after the puberal molting. Regressions between LC and CMQ in males read as: logCMQ = -0,542265 + 1,51.logLC for male juveniles and logCMQ = -1,446281 + 2,37.logLC for male adults. In females, the regressions between LC and LAB were: logLAB = -0,607282 + 1,22.logLC for juveniles and logLAB = -0,912074 + 1,60.logLC for adults. These body dimensions are related to reproductive activities of this species. The level of allometry in CMQ of adult males was the highest among Uca species which relative growth of this dimension is known. The handedness had a proportion of 1:1 between right-handed and left-handed males.

AB  - Relative growth and handedness in the flddler crab Uca maracoani (Latreille)(Crustacea Decapoda Ocypodidae) in the Baixio Mirim, Guaratuba Bay, Parana, Brazil. Relative growth of the male major chela and the female abdomen was studied in a population of the fiddler crab Uca maracoani from Baixio Mirim, Guaratuba Bay, in the municipality of Guaratuba, Parana State coast, Southern Brazil. The male handedness was also analyzed. Major chela length (CMQ) was measured from 486 males, and abdomen width (LAB) from 150 females. Furthermore, 67 crabs without secondary sexual differentiation were analyzed. Carapace width (LC) was the reference dimension for both sexes, which ranged from 3.36 to 34.15 mm for males, from 3.18 to 29.20 mm for females and from 1.27 to 4.82 for crabs without sexual differentiation. Relationship between CMQ and LC showed a transition point at 17.85 mm LC in males, and between LA and LC at 11.75 mm LC in females. Major chela had allometrically positive growth all the male life, while female abdomen had isometric growth in the early ontogenesis and allometrically positive after the puberal molting. These body dimensions are connected with reproductive activity of this species. The dactyl (range 0.82-38.15 mm long) growth in relation to major chela (range 1.36 to 52.35 mm long) was better explained by isometric relationship. The handedness had a proportion of 1:1 between right-handed and left-handed males.

AB  - Distribution patterns of some benthic animals showed a close relation with the occurrence of seagrass species in Haad Cai Mai National Park, southern Thailand. At subtidal sites an infaunal bivalve Pinna bicolor, was present in higher density in Enhalus acoroides beds than in beds of other seagrasses and on bare sand bottoms. While all individuals of the bivalve in Enhalus patches exposed the posterior half of their shells, those in adjacent bare bottom areas exposed just the posterior edge of their shells. At an intertidal site an ocypodid crab, Macrophthalmus quadratus, occurred only in Halophila ovalis beds, and not in unvegetated areas such as bare sand bottoms and dugong feeding trails. In addition, small juveniles of another ocypodid, Uca vocans hesperiae, which occupied burrows, were abundantly seen in Halophila beds. These juveniles had a green body color matching the surrounding Halophila leaves, while individuals of the same species in unvegetated areas had grayish-blue bodies. The relationships between the life-modes of these benthic animals and the structure of their habitats provided by seagrass species are discussed.

AB  - Determining the costs of a given behaviour is critical in the framework of game theory. We estimated the energy costs of male aggression and claw waving in a fiddler crab Uca lactea perplexa, by examining blood glucose and lactate levels under natural conditions. Male fiddler crabs have a single enlarged claw used in courtship waving and fighting. The greatest variation in glucose level was found at the beginning of the activity period, implying variation in 'male quality'. Blood lactate level increased significantly from the early to the middle part of the crabs' activity period. The associated temporal change in behaviour indicated that the increase in lactate was due to vigorous waving. This was confirmed by an enclosure experiment using opaque and transparent fences: the waving frequency was not affected by enclosures with transparent fences but was strikingly lower in cages with opaque fences in which the males could not see and wave at females. The lactate level was significantly higher in transparent fence treatments than in opaque fence treatments. Since the transparent fence prevented aggressive contact between males, the higher lactate concentration in control males than in males enclosed with the transparent fence indicated that aggressive interactions were also costly. In contrast to some vocal displays in songbirds, our results showed that the waving display of the fiddler crab, as well as agonistic behaviour, is energetically costly.

AB  - Fourteen species of brachyuran crabs [Uca pugilator, U. rapax, U. longisignalis, Ocypode quadrata, Sesarma cinereusm, S. reticulatum, Aratus pisonii, Neopanope texana, Panopeus herbstii, Eurypanopeus depressus, Menippe mercenaria, Eurytium limosum, Callinectes sapidus, and Libinia dubia] from Tampa Bay, Florida, were examined for the occurrence and abundance of commensal trichomycetous fungi. Such fungi were found in the hindguts of six of these species, and all fungi observed belonged to the order Eccrinales. Percentage of occurrence of fungi in the infested species ranged from 10% (in Uca pugilator) to 70% (in Uca rapax). The fungi were quantified by estimating the total length of hyphae present in an individual crab. Mean amounts of fungi in the infested species ranged from 0.06 mm of hyphae per crab (U. pugilator) to 36.09 mm of hyphae per crab (Aratus pisonii). Separate collections were made in order to examine occurrence and abundance of fungi in three populations of A. pisonii and four populations of U. pugilator. Percentage of occurrence of fungi in populations of A. pisonii was from 80-95% and mean abundance of fungi was from 76.18-178.0 mm of hyphae per crab. Percentage of occurrence in populations of U. pugilator was from 5-25% and mean abundance of fungi was from 0.12-4.66 mm of hyphae per crab. The patterns of occurrence and abundance of fungi seemed best explained by the feeding habits of a species of crab, those with fungi being herbivorous and/or detritivorous. The present study has been the first to examine this type of fungal infestation from a quantitative perspective.

AB  - Quantitative zooplankton samples were obtained monthly or bi-monthly from June 1974 - May 1975 at 3 stations in lower Delaware Bay [USA]. Two 12 h cruises were conducted at 1 of the stations. Arthropods dominated the samples in number of species and individuals. Zooplankton from surface samples ranged from 58/m3 in Aug. to 21,092/m3 in June, while bottom samples varied from 259/m3 in Aug. to 30,395/m3 in Oct. Larger concentrations of individuals were in bottom samples. On 3 occasions (of 15) meroplankton exceeded the holoplankton at shallow water stations. Meroplankton comprised a larger percentage of the bottom samples than surface samples. Zoeae of Neopanope sayi and Uca sp. contributed to the large proportion of meroplankton in July 1974, veligers of Mytilus edulis in Jan. 1975 and nauplii of Balanus sp. in May 1975. Copepods were the largest component of the population throughout the year. At all stations and depths Acartia tonsa dominated the summer samples. In spring 1975, A. tonsa was replaced by Centropages hamatus, Temora longicornis and Pseudocalanus minutus. During the 12 h cruises there were higher numbers of individuals in the bottom waters in the day with migration to surface waters in the afternoon and evening. Based on cluster analysis, 5 time-related assemblages were discerned: June, July-Aug., Sept.-Nov., Dec. and Jan.-May. Comparison of Delaware Bay zooplankton with other estuarine systems indicated that densities obtained locally were similar to those reported in the York River, Virginia [USA].

AB  - Megalopa of U. lactea (de Haan) (Ocypodinae) and M. (M.) japonicus (de Haan) (Macrophthalminae) were reared in the laboratory. They reached the 1st crab-stage in 4 days. The megalopa and young crabs are described and illustrated. Morphological comparisons are made between the megalopa of these species and those of the already known 12 spp. in the family. The megalopa of U. lactea is much like that of U. pugilator (Bosc) (Hyman, 1920), but the former is distinguished from the latter by having a different number of natatory hairs on the pleopods and a different arrangement of marginal spinules of the telson. The megalopa of M. (M.) japonicus differs from that of Paracleistostoma cristatum de Man (Gamo, 1958) in that the antenna of P. cristatum bears 7 segments (the distal 2 have 1 short and 5 long setae) whereas in M. (M.) japonicus the antenna bears 10 segments (each of the distal 4 have 2 long setae). The megalopa of the Macrophthalminae and Ocypodinae have extremely short 5th pereiopods with 3 feelers on the apex of the dactylus and the antennule bears an endopodite, with the exception of the genus Uca whose megalopa has a vestigial antennular endopodite.

AB  - Males of many species defend resources to attract females. Surprisingly, defense of multiple female breeding sites (e. g., nests or burrows) appears to be rare, primarily reported in fish and birds. In fiddler crabs, burrows are a vital resource for reproduction and survival. Both sexes defend individual territories centered on a single burrow. We examined burrow acquisition and defense in Uca capricornis to test whether males defend multiple burrows as a novel strategy to acquire additional mates. When crabs were experimentally forced to acquire a new burrow, females often settled into an empty burrow near resident males. We documented more empty burrows around males than expected by chance and, in addition, larger males had a greater proportion of empty burrows in their immediate vicinity. We experimentally introduced crabs into empty burrows next to focal males: newly introduced males were soon evicted, whereas females were courted and stayed. These results suggest that male U. capricornis defend empty burrows as a strategy to obtain more mates. Intriguingly, however, U. capricornis tend to occur in socially monogamous pairs. This raises the possibility of sexual conflict within social pairs over the presence of additional females and that female-female competition might constrain male mating success.

AB  - A pigment-dispersing hormone (PDH) from eyestalks of the crayfish Procambarus clarkii was purified by gel filtration, cation-exchange chromatography, partition chromatography, and reversed-phase HPLC. Based on automated sequencing and by the identical chromatographic behavior of the native PDH and the synthetic amidated form of the deduced sequence, the primary structure of Procambarus PDH has been established as: Asn-Ser-Glu-Leu-Ile-Asn-Ser-Ile-Leu-Gly-Leu-Pro-Lys-Val-Met-Asn-Glu-Ala -NH2. This peptide differs from .beta.-PDH of the fiddler crab Uca pugilator at a single position, Glu17 in place of Asp17. Because of this substitution, Procambarus PDH was 4 to 7-fold less potent than .beta.-PDH in causing pigment dispersion in the erythrophores, leucophores, and melanophores of Uca. In contrast, Procambarus PDH was 4-fold more potent than .beta.-PDH in eliciting pigment dispersion in the erythrophores of Procambarus. These peptides displayed less marked differences in potency in triggering leucophore pigment dispersion and light-adaptational distal eye pigment movement in Procambarus. These findings indicate that the structural requirements for PDH-receptor interactions vary with the species and with the target cell type within a given species.

AB  - Fiddler crabs are ubiquitous in tropical and temperate estuaries worldwide. As a common component of intertidal salt marshes, fiddler crabs are one of the principal agents of bioturbation in these systems. Fiddler crab burrowing can modify the physical, chemical, and biological properties of sediments. My study examined the effect of fiddler crab burrowing on sediment reworking, the distributions of 210 Pb and 137 Cs in salt marsh sediments, and the influence of fiddler crabs on the exchange of nitrogen metabolites in salt marsh systems. Fiddler crab burrow density and turnover rates were determined along a transect from the forest to the creek bank at North Inlet Estuary, S.C. Results indicated that there was significant spatial and temporal variation in burrow density. Burrow density ranged from 40 to 300 burrows m -2 with highest densities at the creek bank. Sediment reworking is related to burrow density, turnover, and size. Sediment reworking rates ranged between 4 × 103 and 5.7 × 104 cm3 m-2 y-1 . The distributions of excess 210 Pb and 137 Cs indicated that fiddler crab burrowing mixed the top 8 to 15 cm of sediment. Field measurements of burrow density, turnover, and size were used in a mathematical model to predict the effect of fiddler crab burrowing on 210 Pb profiles. Results suggested that fiddler crab burrowing determines sediment reworking rates and thus, strongly affects sediment composition. Additionally, my study demonstrated that fiddler crab burrows are sites of enhanced nitrification and that fiddler crab burrowing transports ammonium from anoxic sediment at depth to the surface where it may be used in primary production. These results clearly demonstrate that fiddler crab burrowing may be the primary controlling factor for nutrient availability, sediment structure, vegetative production, and remineralization in salt marsh systems.

AB  - Fiddler crabs are one of the principal agents of bioturbation in intertidal salt marshes. The physical, chemical, and biological properties of sediments can be modified by fiddler crab burrowing activity. This study examined the effect of fiddler crab burrowing on sediment reworking and the distributions of Pb-210 and Cs-137 in salt marsh sediments at North Inlet Estuary, South Carolina. Fiddler crab burrow density, turnover, and volume were measured along a transect from the forest to the creek bank. Burrow density ranged between 40 and 300 burrows m(-2) with highest densities at the creek bank. Sediment reworking is related to burrow turnover, density and size. Sediment reworking rates ranged between 4.4 x 10(3) and 5.7 x 10(4) cm(3) m(-2) y(-1). Excess Pb-210 and Cs-137 profiles indicated that fiddler crab burrowing mixed the top 8 to 15 cm of sediment.Direct field measurements of burrow density, turnover, and size were used as input to a modified version of the regeneration model of Gardner et al. (1987) to assess the effect of fiddler crab bioturbation on Pb-210 profiles. The modification takes into account the filling of abandoned fiddler crab burrows from both the infilling of surface sediment and the collapse of burrow walls. Model results were in good agreement with the observed Pb-210 distributions in the sediments. Overall the results of this study suggest that fiddler crabs directly influence sediment composition and biogeochemical cycles in salt marsh systems.

AB  - The 2.4 A crystal structure (R = 0.180) of the serine protease inhibitor ecotin was determined in a complex with trypsin. Ecotin's dimer structure provides a second discrete and distal binding site for trypsin and, as shown by modelling experiments, other serine proteases. The second site is approximately 45 A from the reactive/active site of the complex and features 13 hydrogen bonds, including six that involve carbonyl oxygen atoms and four bridged by water molecules. Contacts ecotin makes with trypsin's active site are similar to, though more extensive than, those found between trypsin and basic pancreatic trypsin inhibitor. The side chain of ecotin Met84 is found in the substrate binding pocket of trypsin where it makes few contacts, but also does not disrupt the solvent structure or cause misalignment of the scissile bond. This first case of protein dimerization being used to augment binding energy and allow chelation of a target protein provides a new model for protein-protein interactions and for protease inhibition.

AB  - Existing paradigms suggest that mangrove leaf litter is processed primarily via the detrital pathway in forests in the Caribbean biogeopraphic realm whereas herbivorous crabs are relatively more important litter processors in the Indo-West Pacific. To test this hypothesis, we used pitfall traps to collect intertidal crabs to characterize the crab fauna in a mangrove estuary in southwest Florida. We also tethered mangrove leaves to determine if herbivorous crabs are major leaf consumers there. We compared the results with previously published data collected in an analogous manner from forests in northeastern Australia. The crab fauna in Rookery Bay, Florida, is dominated by carnivorous xanthid and deposit-feeding ocypodid crabs whereas that of the Murray River in northeastern Australia is dominated by herbivorous grapsid crabs, No leaves tethered at five sites in the forests in Southwest Florida were taken by crabs. This contrasts greatly with reported values of leaf removal by crabs in Australian forests of 28-79% of the leaves reaching the forest floor, These differences in the faunal assemblages and in the fate of marked or tethered leaves provide preliminary support for the hypothesis that leaf litter is in fact processed in fundamentally different ways in the two biogeographic realms.

AB  - Previous supratidal surveys of Twin Cays have documented the role of insect diversity in forest structure and dynamics. Information on other supratidal groups is limited. During the winter and summer of 2004, decapods were surveyed using burrow counts, pitfall traps, time-constrained searches and arboreal counts. Lizard populations were measured in quadrat surveys, while snakes and crocodiles were subject to searches of specific habitat types. Crabs numerically dominated the non-insect fauna; the population of Uca spp. alone was estimated at over eight million individuals. Questions remain regarding the identification of bats seen at Twin Cays and the impact of a large feral dog population on the islands.

AB  - Laboratory measures of whole-animal performance are expected to correlate with morphological indices and Success in activities that contribute to fitness. Males of the sand fiddler crab, Uca pugilator Bose (Brachyura Ocipodidae), possess a single enlarged claw that is used in ritualized contests for possession of breeding burrows, contests may escalate to pinching actions, Suggesting claw closing force as a relevant performance indicator. When a claw is lost, it is regenerated. Within a western Atlantic salt marsh, regenerated claws are less massive and operate at reduced mechanical efficiency relative to original claws, suggesting a less powerful weapon. In the laboratory, the closing force of regenerated claws is less than that of original claws of the same length or mass. Perhaps as a consequence, males with regenerated claws are unlikely to use pinching behaviors and usually lose contests against males with original claws. Males with regenerated claws are less likely to possess breeding burrows that females find acceptable and tend to possess burrows during non-peck breeding times, when the frequency of contests is low. As crabs grow, claw power is sacrificed for greater length. This may facilitate advertising burrow ownership to passing females through claw waving displays. The reduced mass of regenerated claws may permit males to resume effective waving sooner than if they regenerated a Stout claw, but at the cost of competency in contests.

AB  - Male sand fiddler crabs, Uca pugilator, wave a claw to attract females to a breeding burrow. The effect of claw size on the likelihood of attracting mate-seeking females is little studied although in some other species females preferentially approach larger males. We used paired mirrors to reflect different sized images of the same male in a South Carolina (USA) back-beach habitat. Use of mirrors controlled for waving rate (but not velocity), waving motion, claw color, and claw shape. Female choice was attributed to instances in which a female contacted one of two mirrors. Paired mirrors were inclined toward one another in an arena defined by blinds and containing a single male. Two reflections of the male were visible to females moving approximately 50 cm toward the mirrors. The male was behind a small internal blind and not directly visible. In one-half of the trials, a non-magnifing mirror was placed at the bottom of mirrors so that only the elevated claw was magnified. Thus, body and burrow size and apparent distance were controlled. Receptive females preferred the larger reflection whether or not the body of the male was magnified, suggesting the importance of claw size. Non-receptive females did not exercise a choice. Control arenas, without a male, rarely attracted females. The results suggest that females choose on the basis of claw size. Selection on females may favor response to larger-clawed males because use of the claw in contests between males over burrows maintains the honesty of claw size as a signal of burrow quality.

AB  - In fiddler crabs. males develop profound left-right asymmetry as a large claw grows opposite a small feeding appendage. Females are symmetrical with paired small feeding appendages. The claw, used in signaling and contests, may favor adaptive responses in walking legs. This study of sand fiddler crabs, Uca pugilator, investigates differences in leg size and proportion: 1) between major (with the claw) and minor (without the claw) sides, using 404 males front which a pair of legs was removed, and 2) between males and females, using 1085 adults from which a single leg was removed. Among males, only the first walking leg was longer on the major side. This was due to the much greater length of the merus. a proximal long segment that is held parallel to the ground. The merus was longer on the major side in all walking legs. This may permit the claw to be extended away from the body without loss of balance when males either engage in contests over breeding, burrows or wave the claw to attract females to burrows. More distal segments, the long carpus + manus, held approximately perpendicular to the ground, and the dactyl, anchoring the leg to the ground, were longer on the minor side, resulting in longer minor-side legs for the second to fourth pairs of legs. Female legs were proportioned like those on the minor side, with a long carpus + manus relative to the merus. However, rear legs of females are relatively long, which may facilitate holding an eggs mass above the surface. In males, minor-side legs were more massive than major side legs. This suggests a greater work load on the minor side, as during contests that escalate to interlocking of claws, where minor side legs are important in pushing the opponent. Legs of females were more massive than those of males. The greater mass of female legs is not necessary to support an egg mass, which weighs less than the claw of a similar-sized male. The stouter legs of females may facilitate digging out of breeding burrows.

AB  - Males of the sand fiddler crab Uca pugilator possess a greatly enlarged claw that is used as a weapon in ritualized contests for control of breeding burrows and is waved to attract females to breeding burrows. Approximately 5400 crabs were collected along the Atlantic coast of North America at 14 localities, all of which had both beach and salt marsh habitats. Five measurements were made on each claw. Principal components analysis was used to generate a single measure of claw size from the seven correlated measures and scores of the claw. Carapace width was measured to index body size. Claw size was greater in beach than marsh habitats, controlling for body size. However, body size did not differ by habitat type. Claw size was also greater in laboratory-reared males receiving more food, Suggesting chat differential access to food could influence habitat-associated differences in claw size. Chlorophyll a concentration and total organic content, reflecting, respectively, the abundance of benthic algae and other food, were greater in beach than marsh habitats. Moreover, feeding opportunities were greater in the wetter beach habitat because crabs there, but not in marsh habitat, can feed at breeding burrows. Adult fiddler crabs continue to molt and grow in both body and claw size as they age. Energetic investment in the claw relative to the body is plastic. It appears that the availability of food can affect the amount of energy invested in the claw.

AB  - Sand fiddler crab males, Uca pugilator (Brachyura: Ocypodidae), use their single enlarged claw as a weapon in fights for burrows and as a signal to attract females to burrows. Seventy-three males from a South Carolina marsh were in reared in the laboratory to determine if body size at the time of claw loss affects the morphology of the claw that subsequently regenerates. Thirty-six males were induced to autotomize claws and regenerated new ones. Thirty-seven males retained original claws. Across four molts, males regenerating claws gained more in claw length but less in body width and overall mass than males retaining original claws. The first molt accounted for these differences as males regenerating claws gained relatively little in body size but added much in claw length. Regenerated claws were more slender, having smaller dimensions of the manus relative to claw length. As the mantis houses the claw closer muscle, regenerated claws are expected to be less powerful and appear more designed for signaling. Both regenerated and original claws became more slender with increasing length, suggesting that across a lifetime pressures arising from combat are reduced relative to those arising from mate attraction. Among regenerated claws, the height of the manus relative to claw length and the development of teeth and tubercles that facilitate pinching were greater when original claws were lost at smaller body sizes. Consequently, distinguishing original from regenerated claws can be difficult. An index, the score of tooth and tubercle development times the mantis length divided by the product of carapace width and pollex length, discriminated claw types among reared crabs as well as sophisticated statistical techniques. Use of the index suggests that the frequency of regenerated claws increases with population density among neighboring natural populations. The relative size of regenerated claws was greater among males that had relatively large original claws prior to autotomy, suggesting that males may continue to signal their quality by regenerating a new claw that is relatively long.

AB  - The enlarged (major) claw of male fiddler crabs is used in contests over breeding burrows and is waved to attract females. We recently discovered that males of the red-jointed fiddler crab, Uca minax, also use the claw to kill smaller-sized fiddler crabs, U. pugnax and U. pugilator, with which they co-occur in Atlantic coast salt marshes. Large U. minax males use walking legs or the enlarged claw to capture prey feeding on moist sand flats. On sand flats, small U. minax males and females are much less common than large males, suggesting that large males move onto sand flats to seek prey. Males of prey species use the major claw against attacking predators and, consequently, are more likely than females to escape. In laboratory experiments, large U. minax males were more likely to attack and kill small-clawed males and females than large-clawed males, consistent with a preference for more vulnerable, less threatening prey. The size of the major claw is a positive allometric function of body size. The allometric function varies little among species. Also, the mechanical advantage and indices of closing speed and closing force of the major claw, when corrected for body size, are not consistently greater in U. minax relative to prey species. Thus, predation by U. minax males may reflect the opportunity afforded by larger body size and positive allometric growth, which result in a major claw that is more massive than the prey it is directed against.

AB  - An explanation for animal groups is the selfish herd, characterized by aggregation as each member tries to shield itself from a predator by moving into a tight gap between other members. We test the hypotheses that: (1) droves, the large feeding groups of fiddler crabs, are selfish herds; (2) the miniherds that form when droves fragment on approach of a large predator are selfish herds; (3) selfish herds form when refugia are unlikely to be reached before an approaching predator arrives; and (4) the composition of selfish miniherds is biased toward individuals most vulnerable to predation. The study was conducted in South Carolina (USA) by videotaping the movements of sand fiddler crabs Uca pugilator when approached by a human predator. In both droves and miniherds, interindividual distance decreases with predator approach, consistent with behavior in a selfish herd. However, two other expectations for selfish herds-herd cohesion and sacrificing distance from the predator in order to get closer to other herders-are only met in miniherds. Crabs farther from refugia are more likely to form and remain in miniherds, indicating that selfish herding is only favored when refugia cannot be quickly reached. The composition of the smallest miniherds, consisting of 2-18 crabs, is biased toward females and small males. These individuals may be more vulnerable to predation because they lack the enlarged claw of large males that deters some predators. The small miniherds are relatively homogeneous with respect to the size and sex of their members, which may enhance cohesion and effectiveness as selfish herds. Miniherds will be effective selfish groups when predator attack has a significant vertical component and when the strike distance is large relative to both the size of the prey and the distance between group members. Droves are not selfish herds but permit crabs to flee feeding grounds as members of selfish miniherds. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - One of the main hypotheses formulated to explain why marsh birds, wildfowl, and shorebirds forage at night postulates that the birds prefer to feed at night because the feeding opportunities are most profitable then. To investigate this hypothesis, we compare day- and night-time availability and describe the diel abundance rhythm of swimming and benthic organisms inhabiting the shallow waters of a tropical lagoon complex in northeastern Venezuela. Three sampling techniques were used by day and by night: net sampling for swimming organisms, core sampling for those in the sediments (10 cm deep), and sight counts for organisms on the surface of substrata. Overall, in the case of swimming organisms, fishes, isopods, amphipods, shrimps (Penaeus spp.), and corixids were 3-30 times more abundant at night than during daytime. In general, infaunal organisms were about equally abundant during the day and the night, or slightly more abundant during the day. At the surface, isopods, amphipods, and polychaetes were greater than 10 times more abundant at night than during the day. However, gastropods were slightly more numerous during daytime on the substrata, while pelecypods were about equally numerous during day- and night-time. Fiddler crabs (Uca sp.) were generally more available during daytime. Considering all organisms together, the prey for marsh birds, wildfowl, and shorebirds were significantly more abundant at night. In conclusion, tactile-foraging species (e.g., spoonbills, skimmers, ibises, dabbling ducks, and several species of shorebirds) should profit by foraging only at night and resting during the day, and foraging during daylight only to top up a nighttime deficit. On the other hand, despite limited nighttime visual capacity, some sight-feeding species (e.g., herons, plovers) may take advantage of increased prey availability at night, at least on moonlit nights.

AB  - This study was carried out to determine whether or not, and under what conditions, Willets Catoptrophorus semipalmatus and Whimbrel Numenius phaeopus continue to defend and use their daytime feeding territories at night in a tropical environment. The study was conducted in coastal Venezuela by registering, by night and by day, the behaviour and the position of colour-marked and radio-tagged birds. Night observations were made with the use of a light intensifier. In Willets, both territorial and non-territorial birds were observed. The use and defence of territories was observed only on sandy mud areas where Fiddler Crabs Uca cumulanta were plentiful-, the soft mud sites were used only by non-territorial birds. All Whimbrel were territorial. Individuals of both species defending a given space during daytime continued to occupy and defend the same area during the night. The proportion of birds foraging at night was higher on moonlit than on moonless nights. Territorial defence involved alert postures, parallel walks, calls and the chasing of intruders. Agonistic encounters between Willets and Whimbrel and other species were rare. Willets were territorial at all states of the tide except when high tides flooded the territories. Tide had no effect on the time of feeding in Whimbrel. Moonlight was clearly the factor conditioning the occurrence of nocturnal foraging on territories by both species. Foraging strategies and the type of prey and substrata explain why the incidence of night foraging varied with moonlight in territorial Willets and Whimbrels and not in non-territorial individuals.

AB  - Colonization of infauna in a newly constructed mangrove environment at Spanish River Park, Boca Raton, Florida was studied for six months following initial site preparation. Monthly core samples for benthic invertebrates were collected from December 1994 to June 1995. Sampling stations were chosen randomly each month in three zones along two transects across a tidal channel: upper mangrove, lower mangrove, and mangrove/Spartina. Fiddler crab burrows were counted within randomly placed square meter quadrats in each zone. Rapid succession over short-term indicated the constructed environment would eventually become an established, functional mangrove community. Natural infaunal colonization began immediately, and a total of 26 species was collected during the study period. The most abundant species were microdrile oligochaetes, capitellid polychaetes, and dipteran larvae. Fiddler crab holes were first encountered in April 1995 and reached a maximum in June of 42 burrows per m$\sp2.$ No significant zonation (p $>$ 0.05) was found in the most abundant species, average infaunal density, or fiddler crab holes. Samples from two reference sites showed similar faunas, with the organisms found in adjacent channel areas an influencing factor on species diversity and density.

AB  - The spermatozoan of Uca tangeri consists of a large spherical acrosome, a cup-shaped filamentous nucleus, which extends into numerous radiating arms, and a thin cytoplasmic band. Oocytes from ripe ovaries and sperm from seminal receptacles were mixed in filtered sea water, fixed at different times, and examined under a scanning electron microscope. Several spermatozoa became attached by the arms to the surface of each oocyte. The sperm bound to oocytes underwent the acrosome reaction, which started with swelling of the acrosomal vesicle followed by extrusion of its contents. Subsequently, the perforatorium projected forward appproximately 1 mum beyond the apical end of the extruded acrosomal vesicle contents. As the ejected perforatorium becomes the leading edge of the reacted sperm, it is thought to be the constituent at which level membrane fusion between both gametes must occur.

AB  - The acrosome reaction (AR) was induced in sperm from the brachyuran crustacean Uca tangeri either by mixing male and female gametes in filtered seawater or by treating the spermatozoa with the divalent cation ionophore A23187. This latter method provided a sufficient number of reacted spermatozoa to allow a detailed ultrastructural study of the AR. The process consists of two separate phases: a) initial release of the acrosomal vesicle contents, and b) further elongation of the acrosomal filament, which causes reversal of the rigid capsule limiting the acrosomal vesicle contents. The elongate acrosomal filament consists of an apical perforatorium and a basal columnar structure called here the proximal piece. The former derives from the perforatorium of the uninduced sperm stage with only small ultrastructural changes. The proximal piece forms from myelin-like membrane layers which are initially distributed all around the subacrosomal region and then accumulate in a column at the perforatorial base, thus promoting a sudden forward projection of the perforatorium. The AR in brachyurans is thought to be a passive mechanism that utilizes the negative pressure exerted on the nucleus-caused by emptying of the acrosomal vesicle-for an organized accumulation of membrane-rich material immediately behind the perforatorium, with the final result of the raising of a 3-mu-m long acrosomal filament.

AB  - Early spermatids of the crab Uca tangeri consists of the nucleus of granular chromatin and the cytoplasm, which contains a proacrosomal vesicle in close association with membrane lamellae. In the mid spermatids an invagination of the acrosomal vesicle membrane gives rise to the formation of the perforatorium, a spindle-shaped tubule which encloses tubular membranous structures. The pair of centrioles located at the base of the acrosome is not directly involved in perforatorial differentiation. The acrosomal vesicle shows a heterogeneous content composed of the operculum, the thickened ring, and three layers of different materials concentrically arranged around the perforatorium. During the late spermatid stage the nuclear profile differentiates numerous slender arms and the chromatin arranges into fibers. Membranous tubules from the cytoplasm become incorporated into the tubular structures of the perforatorium. The mature spermatozoon has the typical structure of the branchyuran sperm, with a complex acrosome, cupped by the nucleus, and a thin cytoplasmic band intervening between the former main elements. The centrioles are degenerate. The nuclear arms are unusually numerous (more than 20) and lack microtubules or microtubular derivatives.

The general organization of the ossicles is similar for all species and the homologies of the elements can be recognized despite large variations from group to group. The Reptantia are characterized by a complex ossicle organization while the Natantia are characterized by a simple organization. The various types of ossicle organization in the decapod stomach can be arranged in a series ranging from simple to complex. The Brachyura have the most complex ossicle system and the Penaeidea the most simplified. This graded series of complexity closely follows the evolution of the Decapoda.

AB  - Coastal lagoons have long been subjected to anthropogenic disturbances due to the increasingly urbanization pressure along the margins. As a result, the composition, structure and distribution of macrozoobenthic communities are strongly affected by environmental gradients and harsh ecological conditions. This study address the first signs changes in the Piratininga-Itaipu lagoon system, located in the southeastern Brazilian coastline, state of Rio de Janeiro, after the opening of a tidal channel in the most deteriorated area of Piratininga lagoon in April 2008, as part of restoration measures concerning the severe eutrophication of this system. In order to observe changes in environmental conditions and community structure before and after the channel opening, sampling of the benthic macrofauna and abiotic variables were conducted in seven sites, from August 2007 to March 2009. According to statistical tools, no significant differences were shown in both environmental characteristics and community structure before and after the channel at the distinct locations. Nevertheless, local changes in the abundance and composition of species were detected particularly in Piratininga, in the site where the tidal channel was constructed. A remarkable loss in abundance of most opportunistic species and the appearance of six new taxa in Piratininga after the opening of the channel was related to habitat regeneration in virtue of the intrusion of marine waters into the lagoon. However, marine inflow seems to be restricted since no clear evidence of the channel influence was felt in the remaining sites of Piratininga and in Itaipu. Macrobenthic communities were heterogeneous between both lagoons throughout the sampling period, characterized by low diversity and evenness indices. A general increase in salinity and redox potential were observed in Piratininga. Both variables allied to dissolved oxygen appeared to play a major role in structuring the benthic communities. This study is the first contribution to knowledge of taxonomic biodiversity of macrozoobenthic assemblages of Piratininga-Itaipu lagoon system and pioneer in describing apparent ecosystem ameliorations after the channel opening. Therefore, continuous monitoring ought to be carried out in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the tidal channel and follow further recovery of this ecosystem. Macrobenthos were quite heterogeneous between both lagoons throughout the sampling period, with biological attributes showing a remarkable loss in species abundance, mostly opportunistic. The appearance of new taxa, Polydora cornuta, after the opening of the channel was related to improvement of better oxygenation of water and sediments, causing regeneration of habitat. Other resilient taxa with persistant bioturbation activities, such as Allita, Streblospio, Capitella and oligochaetes, dominated the early stages of recovery. This study is the first contribution to knowledge of taxonomic biodiversity of macrozoobenthic assemblages of Piratining-Itaipu lagoon system and pioneer in describing apparent ecosystem ameliorations after the channel opening. Therefore, continuous monitoring ought to be carried out in order to follow further recovery of this ecosystem.

AB  - N-Acetyl-β-glucosaminidase is an exoskeleton-degrading enzyme that exists in the epidermis of crustaceans. Using a primer pair designed on the basis of the consensus regions of N-acetyl-β-glucosaminidase mRNAs of other arthropods, the partial sequence, 790 bps in length, of N-acetyl-β-glucosaminidase mRNA from epidermal tissue of the fiddler crab, Uca pugilator, was characterized. This partial sequence is of 65% identity to N-acetyl-β-glucosaminidase mRNA sequence of the Chinese shrimp, Fenneropenaeus chinensis, and over 50% similar to the N-acetyl-β-glucosaminidase mRNA sequences of insects, such as the tobacco hornworm (Manduca sexta), the spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana) and the silk moth (Bombyx mori). The inducibility of N-acetyl-β-glucosaminidase mRNA in the epidermis by 20-hydroxyecdysone was subsequently investigated using RT-PCR with 18S rRNA as internal control. Our preliminary results indicate that treating Uca pugilator with 20-hydroxyecdysone in vivo can induce N-acetyl-β-glucosaminidase mRNA.

AB  - Because of their chemical stability and lipophilicity, many organochlorine compounds (OCs) can readily accumulate in fatty tissues of crustaceans. Several OCs have been reported to inhibit crustacean molting. To determine whether the disruption of crustacean molting by these OCs involves interference with ecdysteroid signaling in the epidermis, the impacts of five molt-inhibiting OCs on the level of N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase (NAG, EC 3.2.1.30) mRNA in cultured epidermal tissues from the fiddler crab, Uca pugilator, were investigated using quantitative real-time PCR. The NAG mRNA was found to be inducible by 20-hydroxyecdysone (20-HE) in cultured epidermal tissues. The inducibility of NAG mRNA in cultured epidermal tissues by 20-HE is not only further direct evidence that epidermal expression of NAG gene in U. pugilator is controlled by the molting hormone but also validates the use of the NAG mRNA as a biomarker for epidermal ecdysteroid signaling. When Aroclor 1242, 2,4,5-trichlorobiphenyl (PCB29), endosulfan or kepone was administered alone, the expression of NAG gene in cultured epidermal tissues was upregulated, while heptachlor had no effects. Under binary exposure to both 20-HE and an OC, a condition similar to the natural hormonal milieu of epidermal tissues of animals impacted by OCs, both Aroclor 1242 and endosulfan were found to be capable of antagonizing ecdysteroid signaling in cultured epidermal tissues. This antagonizing effect on epidermal ecdysteroid signaling can at least partly explain the inhibitory effects of these two agents on crustacean molting. PCB29, when given together with 20-HE, produced an additive effect on epidermal ecdysteroid signaling but such an additive effect was not observed when kepone was combined with 20-HE.

AB  - Several environmentally persistent chemicals have been found to be capable of disrupting crustacean molting. Considering the importance of molting in the life of crustaceans, there is a need to develop a molecular biomarker that can reflect the disrupting effects of contaminants on ecdysteroid signaling in crustaceans. N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase (NAG) is a chitinolytic enzyme found in crustacean epidermis. The results of the present investigation show that the transcription of NAG gene in the epidermis of the fiddler crab, Uca pugilator, is inducible by the molting hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone, which validates the use of NAG mRNA as a biomarker for molt-disrupting effects of xenobiotics.

AB  - A 3-year study of settlement patterns for three brachyuran crabs (Crustacea: Decapoda) was conducted in two estuaries along the coast of North Carolina, USA. Postlarvae were collected using surface collectors made from ''hog's hair'' filter material. Collectors were checked daily during July-November of 1990-1992. Settlement of Callinectes sapidus, Uca spp. and Panopeus herbstii showed significant yearly variation. Correlations in abundance with lunar period were observed for C. sapidus, with greatest numbers collected during the new and full moons, and for Uca spp. with greatest numbers during the waxing and full moon. Numbers of P. herbstii showed no correlation with lunar periodicity. Wind direction was related significantly to peak settlement for C. sapidus. Tidal amplitude (as related to lunar period) appears most important to larvae reentering the estuary, with wind events influencing retention and reentry of some, but not all species.

AB  - Fiddler crabs are known for their sexual dimorphism and the limits it imposes to feeding in males. We examined the change in morphology and function in Uca pugnax from the newly settled stage where males feed with both claws to the point where it is no longer possible for them to use their display claw to feed. We recorded the fraction of time males spontaneously used feeding or display claws to feed. Up to a carapace width of 6 mm, males use both claws with equal frequency. From 6 mm to 10 mm there is a diminution of the use of the display claw for feeding; above 10 mm it does not happen spontaneously. Is this a morphological limit or a behavioral choice? We excised the feeding claws of male crabs with carapace sizes between 7 - 15 mm and found that up to about 12 mm, crabs could still feed with the display claw. These experiments show that during a time when rapid growth might be particularly favored, young male crabs are not yet handicapped in their feeding by the presence of a developing display claw. As the display claw matures, it increases in size, changes shape and loses small hairs that make it less successful at scooping up sediment.

AB  - It has long been argued that a resident may benefit from helping its neighbor defend a territory against a challenger to avoid renegotiating its boundaries with a new and potentially stronger individual. We quantify this theory by exploring games involving challengers, residents and potential allies. In a simplified discrete game with zero variation of fighting strength, helping neighbors is part of an evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) only if fighting costs are low relative to those of renegotiation. However, if relative fighting costs are high then an interventional ESS remains possible with finite variation of strength. Under these conditions, neighbors may help residents fight off intruders. but only when the resident does not stand a reliable chance of winning alone. We show that neighbor intervention is more likely with low home advantage to occupying a territory, strengths combining synergistically or low probability that an ally will be usurped, amongst other factors. Our Parameterized model readily explains occasional intervention in the Australian fiddler crab, including why the ally tended to be larger than both the assisted neighbor and the intruder. Reciprocity is not necessary for this type of cooperation to persist, but also it is by no means inevitable in territorial species. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The export of mangrove primary production to adjacent habitats has long been regarded as playing a significant role in estuarine food webs. In the Logan River Estuary, a subtropical estuary situated in the southern part of Moreton Bay in Queensland, Australia, we used the fatty acid markers approach to investigate this export and its contribution to the estuarine food web, compared to other sources. During summer and autumn of 2004, 4 stations were sampled along a salinity gradient. Surface sediment samples were collected, using pre-cut syringes, in the mangrove forest of each station and in the adjacent tidal flats. Individuals of dominant crab species were also collected from the mangrove forests. Seasonal differences in fatty acid compositions of the surface sediments within the mangrove forests and along the adjacent banks were recorded, indicating that organic matter inputs varied between summer and autumn. Results also showed that mangrove production was accumulated at the surface sediments in some parts of the estuary during autumn and consequently was not exported to the tidal flat. The fatty acid composition of crab species present in the mangrove showed obvious differences between the grapsid and the ocypodid crabs collected from the estuary. These differences most likely reflect the distinctive feeding strategies of the crab groups, although there was some indication of species-specific biosynthesis/accumulation of certain polyunsaturated fatty acids. The grapsid of this study, Paraseserma erythodactyla, in addition to being more dependent on mangrove leaves than the ocypodid crabs, is shown to potentially feed on fungal biomass.

AB  - Fatty acid compositions of three ocypodid crabs, Uca vocans. U. lactea and Scopimera globosa, collected on a subtropical inter- tidal flat (Okinawa, Japan), were analysed as well as the surrounding surface sediment of their burrows, their food pellets and their faeces. U. vocans and U. lactea exhibited a higher concentration of fatty acids than S. globosa. Food pellets revealed a higher relative contribution of saturated fatty acids and lower amounts of polyunsaturated and branched fatty acids than in the surface sediment samples. These differences of fatty acid compositions suggest an initial selection of food before the particle sorting in the buccal region. This result, and also because of the relatively high fatty acid content of faeces, indicate that fiddler crabs play a significant role in the fate of these lipids in the subtropical intertidal flats. Comparative analysis of the fatty acid compositions of the different samples indicates that these fiddler crabs actively sorted bacteria in order to ingest them. Diatoms seem to be used in larger amount by U vocans may be because of its higher mobility while looking for food. Other primary producers present in the environment, mangrove leaves and algae, have been sorted but contributed weakly to the organic matter pool of the surface sediment and therefore to the diet of the crabs.

AB  - Surface sediments and marine invertebrates, collected from 2 intertidal flats on Okinawa Island, 1 adjacent to a mangrove system, were analysed for fatty acid composition. The detection of fatty acid markers found in mangrove leaves in the organic matter of the surface sediments, coupled with measurements of C:N ratios, showed that organic matter from the mangrove forest tin Oura Bay) is exported to the intertidal flat in both the rainy season and the dry season. This export seems to be higher in the rainy season. However, bacteria, diatoms and macroalgae were the main food source in the surface sediments, as shown by the contribution of their respective fatty acid markers. These markers were also detected in the tissues of the dominant macrozoobenthic species, fiddler crabs and gastropods. Bacteria and green macroalgae were the primary food sources ingested at both sites, irrespective of season. The organic matter derived from mangroves was also ingested by the macrozoobenthos of Oura Bay, while markers of higher plants were not found in the tissues of invertebrate species at Itoman intertidal flat, the site that was not adjacent to a mangrove system.

AB  - Total lipid amounts, fatty acid signature analysis, and C:N measurements were used to investigate the sources of organic matter in an Okinawan estuary (Okukubi, Japan) during the 1999 rainy season. This estuary has a mangrove forest and receives agricultural wastewater. Highest concentrations of total lipids and lowest C:N values were simultaneously found near the pipe where the agricultural water is discharged. Fatty acid profiles in the sediments varied among the stations, indicating differences in the contributing organic sources. Small amounts of lipids and low relative contributions of long-chain fatty acids, markers of vascular plants, were found at stations within and adjacent to the mangrove. These results indicate that the export of organic matter from the mangrove litter to the intertidal flat was limited and spatially restricted. The wastewater seems to induce high amounts of bacteria, macroalgae and benthic diatoms, as indicated by their respective fatty acid markers. The fatty acid profiles of the tissues of two dominant inter-tidal invertebrates, the crab Uca vocans and the gastropod Terebralia sulcata, indicated that their diet was largely comprised of bacteria, Green macroalgae were important food sources for the gastropods; diatoms and mangrove biomass contributed to the nutrition of the crabs, although their contributions were smaller.

AB  - Although fiddler crabs (Uca spp.) are abundant on the mid-Atlantic coast of the U.S., few studies have focused on their role in the ecology of salt marshes. Fiddler crabs, by their activity of burrowing, alter sediment structure and pore water movement. The objective of this study is to compare the effects that changes in fiddler crab density have on pore water chemistry. The site for this study is located on a Virginia barrier island, within the Virginia Coastal Reserve - Long Term Ecological Research area. Four treatments have been assembled parallel to tidal inundation in a randomized block design of 1x1-m plots. The treatments consist of (1) caged crab removal plot, (2) caged burrow addition plot, (3) caged control plot, and (4) un-caged control plot. Pore water chemistry will be analyzed on two scales m2 (the average pore water chemistry for each plot) and cm2 (the water chemistry directly surrounding individual crab burrows). In addition, the effect of these treatments on Spartina alterniflora production will be determined. The presence of fauna in salt marsh restorations is often overlooked. The results of this study will aid in quantifying the importance of fiddler crabs in the development and persistence of restored salt marshes.

AB  - Fiddler crabs (Uca spp.) are abundant on the mid-Atlantic coast of the U.S., yet few studies have focused on their role in the ecology of salt marshes. As a result of their burrowing activity, fiddler crabs alter sediment structure and pore water movement. This research is a portion of a larger project determining the effects of fiddler crab burrow density on the salt marsh ecosystem. The objective of this study was to determine the sphere of influence of individual fiddler crab burrows on surrounding pore water chemistry (cm2 scale), a subject not yet investigated. Four burrows were randomly chosen within a 16 m2 area of a salt marsh; four transects were established radially from each burrow in the four compass directions. Pore water was collected along each transect at distances of 3, 6, and 9 cm from the edge of each burrow. Pore water was collected at a depth of 10 cm using a sampling probe. In the laboratory, samples were analyzed for ammonium, phosphate, and sulfide concentrations, redox potential and salinity. The data were analyzed using a nested ANOVA (transect within burrow) with distance as a continuous variable. Pore water ammonium and phosphate concentrations decreased with distance from the burrow; the difference among sample points was significant for ammonium concentration (p = 0.0039), but there was no significant difference for phosphate concentration (p = 0.0940). Sulfide concentration had the opposite trend, increasing with distance from the burrow, and showed a statistically significant difference among sample points (p = 0.0197). Salinity and redox potential did not vary with distance from the burrow. These results show that crab burrows affect the surrounding sediment pore water to a distance of 9 cm from the burrow edge. Therefore the burrowing activity of fiddler crabs substantially increases the heterogeneity of the marsh sediments.

AB  - We examined claw characteristics of mud crabs (Eurypanopeus depressus, Rhithropanopeus harrisii) to determine if one crab species was potentially more powerful than the other. We related our findings to the abilities of individuals of each species to open epifaunal mytiliform bivalves (Ischadium recurvum; Mytilopsis leucophaeata) that occur on beds of eastern oysters (Crassostrea virginica) in mesohaline Chesapeake Bay. There were high correlations between claw width or height and claw length, and between claw length and carapace width for both mud crab species. The mechanical advantage or "grip strength" of the crusher and cutter claws of both species did not change with crab size (carapace width) and did not differ between sexes in each species, nor did the cutter data differ between species. However, individuals of E. depressus had a significantly stronger crusher claw grip than did those of R. harrisii. Data on mechanical advantage for both species were similar to values reported in the literature for members of other xanthid crab species. These values in turn overlapped those reported for calappid, cancrid, majid, and grapsid crabs, and were greater than those of various species of portunid crabs and individual species of fiddler crab, lobster, crayfish, and ghost shrimp. When simultaneously presented with the two species of bivalves, the mud crabs E. depressus chose mussels of M. leucophaeata first and crabs of R. harrisii chose mussels of I. recurvum first about two-thirds of the time; ultimately, the crabs ate both bivalve species in [>]50% of the choice experiments. The size range in E. depressus was greater than that in R. harrisii, and crabs of E. depressus opened larger bivalves than did crabs of R. harrisii, although similar-sized individuals of the two crab species overlapped in their ability to open bivalves of both species. In Mytilopsis leucophaeata, there is probably no size refuge from predation by the mud crabs whereas the larger mussels of I. recurvum do have a refuge in size.

AB  - In territorial species, it is sometimes less costly to help a neighbour fight off an intruder than to re-establish territory boundaries with a new, potentially stronger neighbour. In fiddler crabs, a male resident will only help his neighbour if he is larger than the intruder who, in turn, is larger than the challenged neighbour. Does this influence with whom a territory-seeking male decides to fight? I show that territory-seeking males appear to choose opponents based partly on the size of the residents nearest neighbour. By avoiding challenging resident males with larger neighbours, territory-seeking males can reduce the likelihood of initiating a fight with a resident who might gain help from his neighbour that decreases the likelihood that the intruder will win the fight.

AB  - In many territorial species males invest substantially in weapons, which they use in fights to acquire and maintain territories that ultimately give them access to females. Females often live within male territories or in female-only areas that are segregated from males. Under these circumstances, females do not have to compete directly with males for space, and in the context of territory acquisition and defence there is therefore no cost to being weaponless. In fiddler crabs, however, weaponless females hold territories among well-armed males. How do they do this? Observations and replacement experiments were carried out on Uca annulipes to determine how males and females acquire and defend territories. Weaponless females were as capable as well-armed males of both acquiring and defending a burrow. Females acquired burrows by seeking out empty ones, while males acquired them by evicting male and female burrow owners. After acquiring a burrow, males mainly fought with male neighbours and females with female neighbours. Both sexes were equally likely to be evicted from their burrow and the likelihood that they remained on their territory for 24 h or more was the same. Males and females thus used different strategies of burrow acquisition and defence, and the male strategy appeared to be more costly. We discuss possible explanations for these differences.

AB  - The costs and benefits of mate choice can vary both spatially and temporally. Phenotypic plasticity in mate choice, which could be due to changes in choice criteria (e.g., acceptance thresholds) or shifts in underlying mating preferences (i.e., relative values assigned to different males), can therefore increase reproductive success. We examined shifts in female mating preference for male claw size between 2 seasons (winter and summer) in the fiddler crab Uca mjoebergi. We used custom-built robotic crabs in 2-stimulus mate choice experiments conducted in the field. Females showed a consistent preference for larger claw size, but this was significantly weaker during winter. This seasonal difference was observed for 2 successive years. We propose that the change in female preference for claw size is due to a seasonal difference in the value of a larger burrow, which strongly influences burrow temperature. Burrow temperature largely determines larval development rate and larvae release in fiddler crabs is constrained to a narrow time window where survival is optimal. Females appear to alter their preference for burrow width, which is signaled by claw size, between winter and summer, potentially allowing them to optimize developmental time of larvae and/or to reduce mate search costs.

AB  - Fiddler crabs are known primarily to be deposit feeders. They eat detritus, bacteria, and other small particles of organic material found in the sandy or muddy substrate on which they live. They have highly specialized mouthparts used to separate edible matter from nondigestable material. Here we provide evidence of cannibalism and predation in a fiddler crab, Uca annulipes. We additionally provide the first evidence of a fiddler crab hunting shrimp and insects. This study is an exemplary reminder that, even though an animal may have evolved highly specialized feeding traits, this need not preclude it from opportunistically acting as a generalist feeder.

AB  - How sexually selected male signals and female sensory systems have evolved so that females can continue to detect and discriminate between potential mates in the face of environmental noise and changes in signaller density has been well studied for acoustic signals. Far less is known about visual signals. We examined the influence of the local signalling environment on male signal attractiveness in the fiddler crab Uca mjoebergi. We used custom-built robotic crabs in two-stimulus mate choice experiments. Females were presented with two identical signals produced in two different signalling environments (simple and complex). The conspicuousness/attractiveness of male claw waving was unaffected by the local environment (physical or social). Male U. mjoebergi appear to produce a signal that is highly conspicuous across a wide range of naturally occurring signalling environments and females seem to have a sensory system that is capable of coping with high levels of environmental noise.

AB  - Although conspicuous courtship displays are an effective way of attracting the attention of receptive females, they could provide valuable information to rival males on the location of these females. In fiddler crabs, males that see a receptive female wave their single, greatly enlarged claw in a highly conspicuous courtship display. We test whether other males use this courtship display to alert them to the presence of receptive females that they cannot directly see. We show that male fiddler crabs (Uca mjoebergi) eavesdrop on the courtship displays of nearby males to detect mate-searching females. This allows males to begin waving before a female becomes visible. Furthermore, males appear to adjust their waving according to the information available: eavesdropping males wave 12 times faster than non-courting males but only 1.7 times slower than males in full visual contact with the female.

AB  - In fiddler crabs both males and females defend territories that are essential for survival. Given pronounced sexual dimorphism in weaponry, how do weaponless females defend their territory from well-armed males? Using observational data and two simple experiments, we test whether male Uca annulipes protect their female neighbours from conspecific intruders. We show that males defend their female neighbours against male but not female intruders. We also show that females sometimes mate with their immediate neighbours. Male defence of female neighbours appears to represent both pre-copulatory mate-guarding and a territorial coalition. Males who ensure that their neighbour remains female could benefit through increased opportunity for future reproductive success and lower boundary maintenance costs.

AB  - It can be less costly to help a neighbor repel an intruder than to renegotiate boundaries with a new and potentially stronger individual. Male fiddler crabs will help a smaller neighbor fight off an intruder when the intruder is intermediate in size relative to the 2 neighbors. Fights involving neighbor coalitions are costly for an intruder because he rarely wins when a larger neighbor intervenes. It might therefore be expected that territory-seeking males will avoid fighting residents that have large neighbors. We found a strong effect of the neighbor's size on whether or not a territory-seeking male initiated a fight with a resident male. Although territorial coalitions in the fiddler crab Uca mjoebergi are relatively uncommon, the potential for them to occur appears to impose strong selection on the fighting decisions of territory-seeking males.

AB  - Non-independent mate selection occurs when the choice behavior of a female is altered by the interactions between other females and males. In the fiddler crab Uca mjoebergi, males court mate-searching females by waving their one greatly enlarged claw. When a female approaches a male, he initiates high-intensity waving. We conducted one natural mate choice experiment and two mate choice experiments using custom-built robotic crabs. We show that the decision of one female to approach a group of males increases the probability that another female will approach and visit a male from the same group. We suggest that this behavior is best explained by the 'stimulus enhancement' hypothesis, where the presence of a female near a group of males makes them more likely to be detected by other females due to an increase in male display rate.

AB  - Courtship displays are often energetically and temporally costly as well as highly conspicuous to predators. Selection should therefore favour signalling tactics that minimize courtship costs while maintaining or increasing signal attractiveness. In fiddler crabs, males court females by waving their one greatly enlarged claw in a highly conspicuous and costly display. Here, we investigate whether courting males adjust their wave rate, and therefore the cost of courtship, to the current level of competition. We show that display rate increases as competition increases and that when competition is removed, males reduce their display rate by 30 per cent. These results suggest that male fiddler crabs actively reduce the cost of courtship by adjusting their wave rate in response to the immediate level of competition.

AB  - The relationship between marsh edge and animal use was examined in a planted Spartina alterniflora marsh located in the Galveston Bay system of Texas. A completely randomized block experimental design was used with each of four blocks containing a control and experimental sector. Marsh edge was increased through the construction of channels in experimental sectors. Channel construction had no detectable effect on marsh surface elevation. Effects of these simulated tidal creeks on habitat use were examined by sampling nekton at high tide with drop enclosures both on the marsh surface and within the channels. Crustaceans dominated the nekton, and use of the marsh surface in experimental sectors was significantly higher than in controls; densities of brown shrimp Penaeus aztecus, white shrimp P. setiferus, and daggerblade grass shrimp Palaemonetes pugio were 4.6 to 13 times higher near the channels. Polychaete densities in marsh sediments were also significantly higher near channels, and densities of decapod predators were positively correlated with densities of these infaunal prey. Thus, channel effects on natant decapods may have been related to the distribution of prey organisms. However, increased densities of natant fauna along the channel edge may simply reflect a requirement for departure from the marsh surface at low tide. Marsh-surface densities of small bait fishes, bay anchovy Anchoa mitchilli and the inland silverside Menidia beryllina, also increased near channels, but highest densities of these fishes were in the creeks themselves. The abundance and distribution of juvenile blue crabs Callinectes sapidus and gulf marsh fiddler crabs Uca longisignalis were not affected by the addition of experimental channels. Overall, the study results indicate that habitat value of created salt marshes can be enhanced by incorporating tidal creeks into the marsh design.

AB  - This study was carried out on the behaviour of two species of sympatric fiddler crabs on Abi estuary, Bandar Abbas, Iran. Species differences in activity level, grooming, burrowing, muddy structure construction and feeding were all related to their habitat and food source. The more common Uca annulipes lives in low muddy areas along the edges of small streams while Uca sindensis lives in small patches on the higher areas with sandier sediment. At low tide, both species spent most of their time feeding, while at high tide they retreated into their burrows. Both species frequently walked while feeding and interacted aggressively. There were similarities in the feeding behaviour of these species: they fed at the same times of the tidal cycles, they were more likely to engage in courtship and mating behaviour during February-September and were least aggressive at this time. In both species, crabs excavated mud balls from their burrows and placed them away from their burrow entrances. There were, however, also differences between the species. Uca annulipes constructed mud hoods at the entrance to their burrows while U. sindensis did not; and the species differed in feeding rate.

AB  - Fiddler crabs are known as the most conspicuous bioturbating animals in mangrove forest, which by their burrowing activities promote nutrient cycling in ecosystems. Mangroves, crabs and bacteria are connected in the form of positive feedback loop, whereby an increase in the activity of any participant will tend to increase the activity of all others as well. Population structure, growth, mortality, recruitment, biomass and production of fiddler crabs as dominant species of deposit-feeder crabs have been investigated from May 2005 to March 2006 in the Sirik mangrove estuary in the eastern part of Strait of Hormuz. Ten 1 m(2) squares of the substrate were randomly sampled during low tide. There was a significant change in organic content in the sampling area during study period. The sex ratio was significantly deviated from 1: 1 ratio in large sizes, where males were dominated year around. Fiddler crabs showed seasonal growth pattern during a year, which the maximum growth was observed during autumn and early summer and ceased during winter by low temperature. Growth parameters were estimated by Appeldoorn's method and fitted with seasonalized von Bertalanffy growth models. The Kimura likelihood ratio test revealed significant differences in the overall growth curves between males and females, originated from the differences in k and L-infinity between sexes. Males were found to exhibit higher growth rate and larger size than females, this could be attributed to the higher investment of energy for reproduction in females. Reproduction was restricted to spring and early summer, while recruitment occurs at the end of summer. Total annual production of males and females was 37.90 and 10.05 g dry weight/10 m(2) respectively and major production took place during early summer. Because of impact of temperature on the activity of fiddler crabs in subtropical regions, density of crabs has significant positive correlation with temperature (P < 0.01), while growth rate shows significant negative correlation with organic matter of sediment (P < 0.05). In conclusion these crabs showed lower mortality and production rate with the seasonal growth and recruitment in comparison with tropical species. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Meiobenthic studies were performed in an intertidal area in the Be River estuary (Nha Trang Bay, Vietnam). The study area is an area of riverine-type mangroves that have been heavily damaged by human impacts, including timber cutting and waste. Three biotopes are situated in the middle intertidal zone: a fringe of Rhizophora stylosa, a bush area composed of Avicennia aff. alba behind it, and muddy sand with fiddler crabs (Uca spp.), which is free of mangrove plants. Three replicate samples of meiobenthos were collected in each biotope and each sample was subdivided into two layers: 0-1 and 1-4 cm. The abundance of metazoan meiobenthos varied from 735 specimens/10 cm(2) in the Uca spp. biotope to 244 specimens/10 cm(2) beneath the Rhizophora trees. Six taxonomic groups of high rank were found among the meiofauna: Nematoda, Copepoda (Harpacticoida), Oligochaeta, Turbellaria, Kinorhyncha, and Foraminifera (Allogromiida). The spatial variability of meiobenthos and its key taxa was estimated and the spatial distribution patterns of free-living nematode species were described. About 90% of the total meiobenthos inhabited the upper 0-1 cm of the sediments. Nematodes constituted 90-95% of all meiobenthic organisms in the samples. A total of 48 species of free-living nematodes were found in the investigated mangrove intertidal area. In terms of species composition and set of dominants, the nematode community is comprised of three local assemblages: one of them inhabits the uppermost centimeter in the Uca and Avicennia biocenoses; the second assemblage occupies the upper sediment layer in the Rhizophora stand; a less abundant but specific assemblage of several nematode species occurs in the subsurface sediments at all three sites.

AB  - Finding of an Uca uruguayensis (Decapode, Ocypodidae) specimen with two hypertrophied claws in Florianópolis, SC, Brazil is reported. A conspicuous threat behavior, made with the two chelae, was displayed by the crab at the time of its capture. Biometrics measures took in this specimen were: maximum carapace (7.92 mm), abdominal (2.20 mm) and chelae widths (3.86 mm, right chela; 3.58 mm. left chela), caparace (5.04 mm.) and chelae length (9.74 mm, right chela; 8.82 mm, left chela) and maximum chelae height (2.14 mm, right chela; 2.06 mm, left chela). Implications of the two hypertrophied chelae on the feeding behavior is discussed.

AB  - A microbial mat is a biosedimentary structure that supports a laminated prokaryotic ecosystem. Filamentous cyanobacteria entangle and bind the sediment grains to form a cohesive upper layer that can be peeled off the ground. The mats I studied on Bird Shoal, North Carolina occurred within a robust, sandy, intertidal ecosystem. Measurement of the surface topography of this sandy tidal flat shows that microbial mat has a smoother and more stable surface than the surrounding sediment. Sand fiddler crabs, Uca pugilator, which co-occur with microbial mats on Bird Shoal, do not affect this added stability even though the crabs do destabilize the sediment surface when they occur alone. The Bird Shoal mats are one of the first documented cases of mats that survive in the presence of grazing and bioturbating macrofauna. A feeding assay developed by Rittschof and Busswell (1985) was used to test the palatability of a mat-forming cyanobacterium, Lyngbya aestuarii. Intact and eye-stalk ablated Uca pugilator fed less when exposed to medium in which Lyngbya aestuarii was grown. This result suggests that Lyngbya aestuarii produces a water soluble substance that is unpalatable to Uca pugilator. This study offers the first evidence that microbial mats may use chemical defenses to ward off grazing. To determine the nature of sediment binding in microbial mats, I developed analytical models of single grain erosion. These models show that gravity should not be the only force considered to counteract erosional fluid forces on sand grains. These models predict that the presence of friction between sand grains actually decreases the critical erosional drag force. Surface tension can increase the force needed to cause erosion of a single grain by four orders of magnitude. In a flow tank designed to approximate parallel plate flow, Bird Shoal microbial mat resisted erosion at much greater shear stresses than did surrounding sediment. This behavior indicates that microbial mats achieve sediment stability by binding grains together rather than by regular maintenance or by shielding of the sand grains.

AB  - The ability of 11 species of planktonic and benthic invertebrates to prey on larvae of two estuarine species of crabs was determined in the laboratory. Ten of 11 of these predators with diverse feeding modes consumed crab larvae. Two of three planktonic invertebrates tested ate more larvae of the fiddler crab, Uca minax (LeConte, 1855), than larvae of the mud crab, Rhithropanopeus harrisii (Gould, 1841), and 4 of 8 benthic invertebrates consumed more U. minax larvae. None of the invertebrates ingested more R. harrisii than U. minax larvae. The larger size of R. harrisii larvae rather than their longer spines likely deterred most invertebrates, although differences in swimming speed, avoidance behavior or penetrability of the exoskeleton also may account for the differential predation on the two species. Available information on the distribution, abundance and feeding habits of potential predators of crab larvae was reviewed and synthesized with results of this study to determine if dispersal patterns of estuarine crabs likely have evolved in response to predictable trends in predation by invertebrates. Preliminary evidence for this hypothesis is equivocal but suggests that particular taxa of hydromedusae are more likely to influence dispersal of estuarine crabs than are other planktonic and benthic invertebrates.

AB  - Tidal variation may cause reproductive timing by fiddler crabs Uca pugilator (Bosc) to vary geographically and seasonally. Fiddler crabs in a semidiurnal tidal regime along the Atlantic coast of the USA were previously shown to release larvae synchronously during maximum amplitude evening high tides near new and full moons throughout the reproductive season. In the present study, fiddler crabs in a diurnal tidal regime on the Gulf coast of the USA released larvae during intermediate amplitude flood tides near dawn regardless of lunar phase throughout most of the reproductive season. Late in the summer, peak larval release occurred near maximum amplitude high tides as on the Atlantic coast. In a mixed semidiurnal tidal regime on the Gulf coast, peak larval release by fiddler crabs occurred during intermediate amplitude high tides near dawn, but biweekly periodicity was weak late in the reproductive season. Intraspecific variation in reproductive timing arose because nocturnal maximum high tides did not occur along the Gulf coast during most of the summer, but these tides returned during late summer in the diurnal tidal regime. Reproductive timing changed concomitantly with changing phase relationships of tides with light-dark and lunar cycles. Variation in reproductive timing is phenotypic because crabs that were translocated reciprocally between diurnal and mixed semidiurnal tidal regimes entrained to the timing patterns of local crabs. A hierarchy of rhythms regulating reproductive timing was revealed by the degree to which larval release kept phase with lunar, tidal amplitude, tidal and lighl-dark cycles. These hierarchies enabled crabs to track phase shifts of cycles in variable tidal environments and may enhance mean reproductive success throughout the range of the species.

AB  - The ability of microscopic larvae to control their fate and replenish populations in dynamic marine environments has been a long-running topic of debate of central importance to understanding the ecology and evolution of life in the sea and managing resources in a changing global environment. After decades of research documenting behaviors that keep larvae close to natal populations, it is becoming apparent that larval behaviors in a broader spectrum of species promote long-distance migrations to offshore nursery grounds. Larvae must exert considerable control over their movements. We now show that larval emigration from estuaries is favored even over minimizing visibility to predators. An enclogenous tidal vertical migration that would expedite seaward migration of Uca pugilator larvae was maintained experimentally across two tidal regimes. The periodicity of the rhythm doubled to match the local tidal regime, but larvae ascended to the surface during the daytime rather than at night. This process would conserve larval emigration but increase the visibility to predators across part of the species range. The periodicity of tidal vertical migration by Sesarma cinereum larvae failed to double and was inappropriately timed relative to both environmental cycles in the absence of a diel cycle. The timing system regulating tidally timed behaviors in these two species of crabs evidently differed. Phenotypic plasticity can conserve larval transport of both species when tidal and diel cycles are present. It may be widespread in the sea where diverse habitats are encountered across extensive species ranges.

AB  - Synchronous release of gametes or larvae by marine animals may be controlled by as many as four environmental cycles thereby enabling an array of reproductive timing patterns. Cohesive scenarios that account for the diversity of reproductive patterns are rare and tests of their adaptive significance have been even rarer. By exploiting plasticity in the timing of larval release, we isolated proximate factors regulating reproductive synchrony and provided evidence that predation ultimately may best explain the diversity of hatching patterns by brachyuran crabs. Tides entrain reproductive rhythms by many crabs, and therefore spatial and temporal variation in tides produces intraspecific variation in reproductive patterns. This was demonstrated by determining the timing of larval release of the same or sibling species of intertidal crabs in Pacific semidiurnal and Caribbean mixed semidiurnal tidal regimes on the two coasts of the Republic of Panama. The time of larval release varied during the year in the Caribbean, where entraining physical cycles exhibited complicated changes in phase, but not along the Pacific coast, where the phase relationships among physical cycles varied little year-round. Crabs timed larval release relative to the light-dark, tidal phase, and tidal amplitude cycles, but not the lunar cycle, suggesting that three rhythms determined when larvae were released. For each species we ranked these rhythms by the degree to which larval release kept phase with their entraining physical cycles. The species-specific hierarchies of rhythms we observed match those expected if the time of larval release minimizes predation on females, embryos, and newly hatched larvae. Such hierarchies enable crabs to track phase shifts of cycles in variable tidal environments and may enhance reproductive success across tidal regimes. However, larval release may be timed better in some tidal regimes than others due to differences in the phasing of environmental cycles. In some tidal regimes, larval release cannot be synchronized with all three physical cycles during the year, and hierarchies of rhythms may determine the timing and duration of breeding.

AB  - The adaptive significance of synchronous larval release by marine animals has been elusive. The hatching times of 10 species of intertidal crabs were determined and compared to those expected if crabs release larvae when predation on females, embryos, and newly hatched larvae is least. The safest time to release larvae occurs during the largest-amplitude nocturnal high tides of the lunar month. Crabs throughout the intertidal zone can release larvae near their refuges, and larvae will be transported rapidly at night from shorelines where diurnal planktivores abound. High and middle intertidal species released larvae at this time, which suggests that predation on all three life stages ultimately may synchronize reproduction. Unlike these species, low intertidal crabs are inundated every day, and therefore females could release larvae near refuges daily. Although one low intertidal species did release larvae every day and often during the daytime, two other species released larvae during the safe period. The timing of larval release by low inter-tidal crabs varies with the vulnerability of their larvae to planktivorous fishes. The hatching times of 46 species worldwide support our contention that predation, primarily on newly hatched larvae, and not other sources of mortality, selects for synchronous hatching by crabs.

AB  - Unlike most zooplankters, larvae of decapod crustaceans and fish often are pigmented and may hatch and ascend to the sea surface during the day. Chromatophores possibly protect these larvae from ultraviolet radiation (UVR), but may increase their visibility to planktivorous fish. We exposed larvae of four species of tropical crabs to sunlight and to planktivorous fish in the field to address this paradox. Most lightly pigmented larvae of three species died from exposure to sunlight within 1 d, and 94-97.5% of them died after 2 d. The more darkly pigmented Pachygrapsus transversus larvae survived significantly better; only 5 7% of them died after 2 d of exposure to sunlight. These darkly pigmented larvae survived encounters with fish as well as or better than larvae of two other species, that did not have large melanophores. Larval chromatophore systems may block UVR without greatly increasing the visibility of larvae to fish. Larvae that migrate from adult habitats to nursery grounds in surface waters throughout the day likely have chromatophore systems that are effective against both of these countervailing selective pressures; however, increasing UVR may stress larvae. The timing of larval release relative to the diel cycle was not related to the susceptibility of larvae to photodamage.

AB  - Most shallow-water crabs release larvae during nocturnal maximum amplitude high tides, when larvae are rapidly transported by strong ebb tides to deeper waters at night. Larvae released at this time may avoid being eaten by planktivorous fishes, which abound in shallow water and feed during the day. Eurypanopeus planus (Smith, 1869), Uca beebei (Crane, 1941) and Pachygrapsus transversus (Gibbes, 1850) live on the Pacific coast of Panama and often release larvae during the day. Eurypanopeus planus also releases larvae without regard to tidal amplitude. Unlike most crabs, larvae of these three species will encounter, not avoid, planktivorous fishes. The predator avoidance hypothesis predicts that these larvae should be relatively well protected from predation compared to larvae of species that are released when predators are avoided. We tested this prediction experimentally by exposing larvae of these species and the sympatric crab, Cataleptodius taboganus (Rathbun, 1912), which exhibits the common hatching pattern, to silversides, Membras gilberti an abundant diurnal planktivore that feeds where all species release larvae. The rank order of silversides' prey preferences matched that predicted from the timing of larval release; Larval vulnerabilities to predation were related to the apparent conspicuousness of larvae, which is determined by the color of yolk and chromatophores. A survey of 30 other species of crabs further indicates that conspicuously colored larvae are released when they best avoid predators and that inconspicuously colored larvae may be released at other times.

AB  - Contest duration in animals is often interpreted as being a consequence of mutual assessment of the difference in the competitors' resource-holding potential (RHP), allowing the inferior individual to avoid costly interactions it is likely to lose. Duration is thus predicted by the relative size of the competitors, and increases as the difference between them decreases. Alternatively, each individual may persist in accordance with thresholds determined by its own RHP, and weaker rivals retreat because they have lower thresholds. Contest duration depends on the RHP of the contestant that gives up first. Recent work suggests that even though duration is determined by the loser's size, this hypothesis also predicts a negative correlation between duration and the relative RHP of the contestants. However, it predicts (unlike the mutual assessment hypothesis) that contest duration should increase with the mean size of the contestants. We studied the determinants of fighting duration in the fiddler crab Uca mjoebergi. Fight duration increased with increasing size of the loser, and decreased, but to a lesser extent, with increasing size of the winner. Fights between size-matched individuals increased in duration with increasing mean size of the competitors. Neither the mutual assessment nor own-RHP-dependent persistence hypotheses can accurately explain the data. Instead, we present a modification of recent modelling work, and suggest that in U. mjoebergi individual cost thresholds may determine duration, but that larger opponents may inflict those costs more rapidly, consistent with the cumulative assessment game of animal conflict.

AB  - Pigment-dispersing hormone (PDH) acts to disperse pigments within the chromatophores of crustaceans. Using an antibody raised against beta-PDH from the fiddler crab Uca pugilator, we characterized the distribution of beta-PDH-like immunoreactivity in the stomatogastric nervous system of five decapod crustaceans: the crabs, Cancer borealis and Cancer antennarius, the lobsters, Panulirus interruptus and Homarus americanus, and the crayfish, Procambarus clarkii. No somata were stained in the stomatogastric ganglion (STG) or the esophageal ganglion in any of these species. Intense PDH-like staining was seen in the neurophil of the STG in P. interruptus only. In all 5 species, cell bodies, processes, and neurophil within the paired circumesophageal ganglia (CGs) showed PDH-like staining; the pattern of this staining was unique for each species. In each CG, the beta-PDH antibody stained: 1 large cell in C. borealis; 3 small to large cells in C. antennarius; 3-8 medium cells in P. clarkii; 1-4 small cells in H. americanus; and 13-17 small cells in P. interruptus. The smallest cell in each CG in C. antennarius sends its axon, via the inferior esophageal nerves, into the opposite CG; this pair of cells, not labeled in the other species studied, may act as bilateral coordinators of sensory or motor function. These diverse staining patterns imply some degree of evolutionary diversity among these crustaceans. A beta-PDH-like peptide may act as a neuromodulator of the rhythms produced by the stomatogastric nervous system of decapod crustaceans.

AB  - Monthly field sampling of active animals in a Louisiana coastal salt marsh monitored changes in size class frequency distributions, ovarian development of females, and rates of egg extrusion for two species of Uca endemic to the Gulf of Mexico. Ovigerous females occurred no earlier than February for Uca spinicarpa and April for Uca longisignalis. Peak percentages of ovigerous females were observed in June 1992 for Uca longisignalis (67%) and in March 1993 for Uca spinicarpa (85%). Peaks in ash-free dry weight (AFDW, in g) of females coincide with peak periods of ovarian development and subsequent ovigery. Mean biomass as AFDW of males and females combined for Uca longisignalis was 0.26 g individual(-1) and for Uca spinicarpa was 0.17 g individual(-1). A significant correlation existed between AFDW and carapace width in both species, males and females. U. longisignalis appears to be of warm-temperate lineage, and its reproductive activity is the more seasonally restricted, with later ovarian development, earliest egg laying delayed to late spring, and peak ovigery in summer. In keeping with putative tropical affinities of Uca spinicarpa, ovarian development is episodic over a longer period from late winter to summer, and eggs are produced earlier in the year. The more striking seasonality in reproductive activity and biomass peaks for Uca longisignalis may also reflect some nutritional dependency on temperate, annual marsh plants that characterize its preferred habitats.

AB  - The distribution of fiddler crab (Uca spinicarpa and U. longisignalis) burrows in coastal marsh habitats is described, and the influence of substratum characteristics on the distributions of each is examined. Burrow densities were higher in vegetated areas than in sparsely vegetated and nonvegetated areas. Elevation and landward distance from shoreline (water's edge) also co-varied with burrow densities along transects. Burrow aperture diameters and burrow numbers m(-2) exhibited seasonal variations for both species of Uca. The depth of burrows increased with increased distance from the water's edge (approximate mean sea level) along transects into the marsh. A significant correlation between burrow aperture diameter and carapace width of the inhabitant enabled subsequent estimates of size and biomass in populations. Mean burrow densities for U. longisignalis ranged from a high of 182 m(-2) in September 1992 to a low of 26 m(-2) in May-June 1992. Mean burrow densities for U. spinicarpa ranged from a high of 46 m(-2) in March-April 1993 to a low of 29 m(-2) in May-June 1992. Estimates of mean biomass ranged from 17.6 g AFDW m(-2) to 13.2 g AFDW m(-2) for a U. longisignalis-dominated site and from 6.5 g AFDW m(-2) to 4.9 g AFDW m(-2) for a U. spinicarpa-dominated site. Field observations and laboratory soil-choice tests demonstrated that, in mixed populations, U. spinicarpa preferred to burrow in substrates of big-her percent clay than did U. longisignalis.

AB  - The fiddler crab, Uca minax, has a complex lifecycle. Juvenile and adult stages occupy benthic habitats in estuaries and along the banks of tidally influenced rivers, and larval stages develop in the plankton of the coastal ocean. Bridging the gap between coastal planktonic and estuarine benthic habitats is the megalopal stage, also known as the postlarval settlement stage. Megalopae ride nocturnal flood currents into estuaries to locate appropriate settlement sites. In the process, they move from stable ocean salinities to the fluctuating environment of the estuary. In this study, we compare the osmotic tolerance of adult and megalopal U. minax to determine if it is equivalent in both stages of life. Adult crabs were collected from benthic habitats in the Winyah Bay (oligohaline), North Inlet Estuary (euhaline) and the Great Pee Dee River (oligohaline) in South Carolina. Megalopae were collected from the Pee Dee and Waccamaw rivers using light traps. Both adult and megalopal U. minax were subjected to 12 concentrations of seawater between 40 – 3320 mOsm/Kg (pH 8.0). Survivorship was assessed in adults after 5 days and in megalopae after 24 hours of osmotic challenge. Both adults and megalopae had excellent survival in the lowest concentrations. The upper lethal concentration (ULC50) was 1384, 1350 and 2200 mOsm/kg for adults from The Great Pee Dee, Winyah Bay, and North Inlet Estuary, respectively. Megalopae from the Pee Dee and Waccamaw rivers showed an ULC50 of 1246 mOsm/kg. Since megalopae and adults from oligohaline habitats have similar osmotic tolerance, this suggests that the settlement stage of U. minax has well developed osmoregulation capabilities.

AB  - Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB's) are a class of industrial chlorinated hydrocarbons which are toxic to a broad range of organisms, persistent in the environment, and tend to accumulate in estuaries, where they are available to organisms at all trophic levels. Greenhouse and laboratory studies were initiated to characterize the interaction of Spartina alterniflora Loisel. and the PCB's. Particular areas addressed were: (1) uptake, translocation, and accumulation, (2) selectivity of uptake, (3) effects of uptake and/or exposure of PCB's on S. alterniflora growth, and (4) potential for transfer of PCB's from S. alterniflora and marsh substrate to Uca pugnax (fiddler crab). In a greenhouse study it was concluded that S. alterniflora has the capacity to take up, translocate and accumulate ('14)C-radioactivity from sand and marsh mud originally treated with ('14)C-PCB's. Additional studies with the commercial PCB mixture, Aroclor(REGTM) 1254, were conducted and results confirmed the presence of PCB cogeners in samples of S. alterniflora tissues. Results of another greenhouse study demonstrated that PCB uptake was selective for the lesser chlorinated components of Aroclor(REGTM) 1254. Selectivity resulted in greater accumulation of the lesser chlorinated components in aboveground (stems and leaves) tissues than in belowground (roots and rhizomes) tissues. In general, plant tissues had greater relative concentrations of the lesser chlorinated components. Soil samples reflected this disproportionate loss of the lesser chlorinated components by increases in the relative concentrations of the more chlorinated components. Additional studies demonstrated that S. alterniflora growth was altered by PCB's placed into sand or mud, relative to control plants. Effects of PCB's on growth were assessed by measuring weight, height, number of live leaves, and number of tillers. Effects on growth were due to the interaction of PCB's and soil constituents and the cumulative impact of these over time. Fiddler crabs (U. pugnax) were exposed to ('14)C-PCB's applied to marsh substrate or S. alterniflora plant material which had been grown in the presence of ('14)C-PCB's, to determine if marsh substrate-to-organism and plant-to-organism PCB transfer was possible. Results indicate that transfer from both sources occurred but that accumulation of ('14)C-radioactivity was only observed with crabs exposed to ('14)C-PCB treated substrate. Concurrent measurements of ('14)CO(,2) evolution suggest that ('14)C-PCB's in plant tissues may undergo different decomposition processes than soil borne ('14)C-PCB's as fiddler crab activity altered the rate of ('14)CO(,2) evolved from plant material but not for that derived from ('14)C-PCB applied to marsh substrate.

AB  - Animals can change color either rapidly in response to changes in their immediate environment or slowly as the seasons change. Such plasticity can permit local adaptation but it can also be constrained by physiological and behavioral mechanisms. Here, we explore how different temperature regimes along a latitudinal gradient spanning the natural range of a species of fiddler crab may affect the ability of crabs to change color rapidly in response to acute changes of temperature. Uca pugilator populations from New York (NY), North Carolina (NC) and Florida (FL) were exposed in air to 5 degrees C and 35 degrees C and carapace shade intensity (from dark to light color) and contrast was recorded. In general, individuals darkened when exposed to cold conditions, and lightened when exposed to warm conditions. Males from different populations differed in the magnitude of response to temperature, but had similar directional changes in shade (dark under cold conditions and light under warm conditions) suggesting differences among populations in the ability to change color. Females showed similar directional changes but there were no differences among populations. Differential responses of crabs to temperature suggest that crabs have local physiological adaptations and can acclimate quickly to withstand fluctuating or extreme temperatures.

AB  - The male of Uca (Deltuca) arcuata, a vertical claw-waving fiddler in the Indo-Pacific, is used to court females by approaching them from his burrow or while wandering. Differences in the rate of encounters with females between burrow-holding males and burrowless wandering males are found not to be significant. Burrow-holding males less often cause displacement of wandering by females than wandering males do. Wandering of females caused by wandering males occurs as often as wandering of males caused by other males. Thus, burrow-holding males tend not to reduce the number of their potential mates in the neighborhood.

Burrow dwelling males are apt to start wandering after decreased encounters with females. Wandering males experience more interactions with other males than burrow-holding males do. Most wandering males that displace burrow owners descend the burrows one or more times after displacing the owners. The extra fighting for temporary burrows is responsible for no increase of the encounter rate with females during wandering.

AB  - The male courtship display of the fiddler crab Uca perplexa is a conspicuous claw waving that is directed at females to attract them to their burrows for mating. Like most other fiddler crabs, this species has an approximately biweekly reproductive cycle with mating spread over about 10 days. However, most mating takes place in the 3 days immediately preceding new and full moons. We examined the relation between the time males spend waving to females and the time they subsequently spend underground in their burrow, guarding their mates until they ovulate and then fertilizing their eggs. Early in the mating period, males courted females for about 3-5 s before the female entered their burrows, and males guarded these females for 3-5 days. During the 3 days of peak mating activity, courting time decreased significantly to about 2 s and guarding time decreased to about 1 day. This pattern cannot be explained by females preferring extended waving periods, decreased female choosiness towards the end of the mating period or variation in male waving over the mating period. We conclude that males of this species modulate their investment in courtship according to changing levels of female responsiveness to courtship.

AB  - The fiddler crab Uca perplexa has a conspicuous male courtship signal that is directed at females to attract them to the male's burrow for mating. The signal involves waving the unflexed large claw up and down. To determine whether the spatiotemporal structure of the wave is under selection by female choice, we examined whether females had a preference for any particular features of the wave. Females respond to a waving display by either visiting the male's burrow entrance or by electing to pass without visiting the burrow. We filmed mate-searching females and the waving males that they visited or passed. We documented the wave structure of these males using frame-by-frame analysis. Males produce a two-part wave with component A preceding component B. Both components have an upstroke, a pause at the apex and a downstroke. The tip of the claw was raised much higher in B than in A. Visited males had a shorter delay between the two wave components than did males that the females passed without visiting. Visited males also produced component B waves that had a slower upstroke than those of passed males. There was a significant correlation between the relative height of the raised claw and the duration of the upstroke of component B. Females were selecting males that raised their major claw to the highest position (two to three times as high as the carapace width). Passed males brought down their major claw earlier and from a lower position than did visited males. The data suggests that wave structure has evolved through female choice. Male display rate and body size were not female choice cues. An earlier study showed that display duration was also not used by females in selecting mates.

AB  - Claw size of male fiddler crabs, Uca perplexa appears to be a target of female choice that increases the likelihood a female will initially approach a male. Here we show that a behavioral display trait, the maximum height that the tip of the claw reaches during a courtship wave, is a strong correlate of the subsequent likelihood that a female will visit a male's burrow (which is a prerequisite for a burrow mating). We experimentally manipulated claw mass, to test whether there is a trade-off between claw mass and wave height. Males with a metal weight added to their claw showed a large reduction in wave height, whereas control males (plastic added) showed no net change in wave height. There is therefore a trade-off between these two sexually selected traits (claw size and wave display). More importantly, the greater the initial wave height the smaller the subsequent decline in wave height. Assuming that variation in wave height is an index of quality, this variation in the cost-benefit trade-off is consistent with the requirements of a signaling system that conforms to the handicap principle when fitness is the multiplicative product of different fitness components. We conclude by discussing the ongoing difficulties in testing the handicap principle.

AB  - Male Uca rosea copulate on the surface of the ground. The vertical type of waving is typical for this species. The claw was raised, stopped at the highest position, and lowered. Jerks were present for the upstroke and the downstroke. The display, however, is nonrequisite before surface mating. In this study, we found that some male U. rosea attracted females into their burrows for underground mating by waving. When a male U. rosea approached close enough to a wandering female, he waved toward her and walked back to his burrow. The male did not enter the burrow, but continued waving while passing his burrow, and, if she entered it, he then followed suit. When a male executed vertical waving toward a female, this behavior led the female closer to his burrow. Male leading of the female was present, but took different forms from that in the subgenus Celuca. The initiation of wandering of most females was associated with their eviction by wandering males. Wandering did not occur spontaneously, because most wandering females had stored sperm supplied from surface matings in their spermathecae. Female U. rosea sometimes descended into burrows during wandering. Pairing underground with a wandering female also occurred sporadically without her responding to waving. They occupied an empty burrow in which they formed pairs. If wandering females did not enter empty burrows, they entered male burrows, where no waving occurred. They need no sperm, but enter burrows probably for replenishing water. The male elicits copulation from the female in exchange for access to his burrow or a near empty burrow. Many pairs did not involve waving. The ovulation rate by female mates was similar between waving and nonwaving males.

AB  - Uca tetragonon is an Indo-West Pacific species of fiddler crab in the narrow-front (NF) species group. Male Uca tetragonon used display by claw-waving to attract females into burrows of males for mating. Pairing attempts by male Uca tetragonon attracting conspecific females into their burrows occurred in 2 different ways. In type 1, males entered their burrows after their mates did, and, in type 2, males entered their burrows first and their mates followed. Both types occurred with similar frequencies. Rate of pair formation and spawning rate of paired females were not significantly different between the 2 types. Nine of 20 females spawned in the pooled data from both types.

In Indo-West Pacific fiddlers, type 1 pair formation (female first) has been found in the 5 subgenera (NF and the broad-front species (BF) group) and type 2 (male first) previously only in the BF group, but now also in Uca tetragonon. Type 1 is common to all subgenera of Uca in the Indo-West Pacific, a criterion typical of ancestral characters. Since NF and BF groups are distinctly different in phylogenesis as well as in their ecology, type 2 pair formation is supposed to be a derived behavioral character in NF fiddlers, having evolved independently from the BF group.

AB  - Male fiddler crabs, Uca paradussumieri, mate underground during a 4- to 7-day period each full and new moon. As soon as the tide recedes, males enter the burrows of females that will ovulate the following day ('pre-ovigerous' females). Males copulate with and guard these females until they ovulate. When interrupted by an intruding male, the first male to reach the female is usually able to defend her and successfully mate with her. In fiddler crabs, females mate multiply and there is last male sperm precedence. Before each semi-lunar mating period, male U. paradussumieri were more likely to court females with whom they would later mate than other nearby females with whom they did not mate. This suggests that males collect information on female reproductive state prior to the females becoming ovigerous. In this species, aggression was common between males that courted the same female. When previously courted females were approached by other males, the initial courter attempted to forcefully disrupt the courtship. This behavior may allow males the exclusive use of information on female reproductive condition. It also suggests a type of scramble competition between males over females. Furthermore, it indicates that males are able to locate receptive females prior to their becoming ovigerous. The shorter guarding period observed in this species, as compared with other fiddler crabs, is caused by females rejecting longer guarding periods. Male ability to assess female reproductive status may therefore be advantageous because it increases male mating success within a scramble type of competitive polygyny.

AB  - Males of several fiddler crab species sometimes construct sand structures (referred to as "hoods" in Uca lactea) at the entrance to their burrow, to which they attract females. Like the bowers of bowerbirds, sand structures of fiddler crabs are external ornaments that exist physically apart from the animals. Despite the mating benefit gained by possessing a structure, many males do not construct structures and some males even destroy their own structures. Structure destruction cannot be explained by the time and energy costs associated with structure construction or maintenance. This implies that the possession of a structure alone can be costly. In the present study on U. lactea, I experimentally planted hoods at the burrows of males that did not have hoods, and compared their frequency of hood destruction with that of control males (builders whose hoods were replaced with those of other males). Non-builders destroyed planted hoods more frequently than control males. Females, which do not construct hoods, also destroyed experimentally planted hoods more frequently than control males. Hoods are able to attract females, but the possession of hoods may incur some costs for crabs, probably because hoods also attract males and non-rceeptive females. Hence, only males that can afford the costs are likely to construct hoods.

AB  - In iteroparous animals, individual decisions about when and how much to invest in reproduction are related to lifetime reproductive success, and the ability to assess one's own competitive ability in one's current condition is necessary for optimising the reproductive investment. Male fiddler crabs have an enlarged claw which is used for courtship and combat, but they sometimes lose the claw. The clawless males would have disadvantages in courtship and combat until they regenerated the claw. Here it is examined whether males modify their reproductive investment in response to their current condition. Most clawless males did not construct sand structures to attract females; thus, they invested little in current reproduction. Small males were also less likely to construct structures. Clawless and small males may invest little in current reproduction and instead allocate energy to claw regeneration or body growth for future reproduction, or invest in in alternative mating tactic, such as surface mating.

AB  - Males of several species of fiddler crabs construct sand structures at the entrance of their burrows, to which they attract females for mating. Although sand structures are able to attract females, males do not always construct structures, and there is a considerable variation in the frequency of structure construction per day. To determine what factors cause the variation in the frequency of structure construction, I conducted a field observation on the structure construction of Uca lactea and examined the effects of air and soil temperatures, tidal amplitude, male and female densities, and the interaction between male and female densities. The frequency of structure construction was related to tidal amplitude. This may be a male response to the changing levels of female receptivity associated with the tidal cycle. The frequency of structure construction was also correlated positively with air temperature. Although courtship investment is expected to be influenced by the number of mates and rivals, neither male nor female density were significantly correlated with the frequency of structure construction.

AB  - Multiple signals that convey different messages have been reported in many taxa, but relatively few studies have been made on such signals in invertebrates. In the present study, I investigated four types of claw-waving display used in the fiddler crab Uca lactea to test whether the displays have different functions. Three males with a sand structure beside their burrows (which can attract females) and three males without a sand structure were fenced in an opaque enclosure, and I videotaped their waving displays after releasing two burrowless males or two burrowless females to test the effects of audiences. (a) Lateral-circular waving tended to occur in enclosures with burrowless females and was performed frequently by males that had sand structures. (b) Lateral-flick waving was performed frequently by males without sand structures, and its frequency was positively correlated with the signaler's body size. (c) Rapid-vertical waving was observed frequently in enclosures with burrowless males, and its frequency was negatively correlated with the signaler's body size. (d) Circular waving tended to occur in enclosures with burrowless females and was performed frequently by males that had sand structures, and its frequency was positively correlated with the signaler's body size. In my previous study, lateral-circular waving was often seen in the breeding season and was mostly performed to female audiences, lateral-flick waving was frequently performed to neighboring resident males, rapid-vertical waving was performed mainly to intruding burrowless males, and circular waving did not have apparent audiences in most cases. Finally, I concluded that lateral-circular waving was used as a courtship display, lateral-flick waving was related to border disputes, rapid-vertical waving was used for burrow guarding, and circular waving was used to broadcast the signaler's general quality.

In the fiddler crab, Uca lactea, I found that males performed at least four types of claw-waving display: lateral-circular, lateral-flick, rapid-vertical, and circular waving. The major audiences and the seasonal occurrence patterns of the displays differed among waving types. Lateral-circular waving (combinations of slow lateral extension, quick flexion, and circumduction of the major claw) was mostly performed to female audiences and was observed frequently in the breeding season. Lateral-flick waving (quick lateral abduction to the audience) was frequently performed to neighbor residents but rarely performed to females in the breeding season. Rapid vertical waving (rapid dorso-ventral protraction and retraction) was observed throughout the observation period and was most frequently performed to burrowless males. Circular waving (simple circumduction) was frequently observed prior to the breeding season and had no obvious audience in most cases. The results showed that males performed different types of claw-waving in different contexts. Males may have needed to use several different types of waving in order to transmit different messages.

AB  - Several species of fiddler crab (Uca) exhibit two types of mating tactics; some males wave their large claw to attract females into their own burrows (underground copulation), and the other males directly visit females’ burrows (surface copulation). In these species, males of at least four species occasionally build sand structures around their burrows which may attract females into the burrows. The presence of the sand structures would provide a great advantage for males that attempt the underground copulation, whereas the structures give probably no benefit for males that attempt the surface copulation. Therefore, the occurrence of structure building may be associated with mating tactics of males. To test this hypothesis, I examined the frequency of the structure building of males that lost their large claw in U. lactea, which exhibits two types of mating tactics. Males that lost their large claw and cannot perform waving still exhibit the surface copulation, whereas they cannot employ the underground copulation because waving of the large claw is essential for this type of copulation. If the sand structures provide an advantage only for the underground copulation, males that lost their large claw are predicted not to build structures. As expected, none of the males that lost their large claw built structures in my observation. Because males do not use large claw to build structures, it is highly probable that the sand structures are built by only males that attempt the underground copulation.

AB  - Crabs of the genus Uca Leach, 1814 are characterized by having strong sexual dimorphism and a global distribution. Currently, 97 species have been described and analyzed under several aspects, including population ecology, physiology and ethology. However, there is no general summary of the information from the various literatures. The aim of this study is to perform a scientometric analysis of fiddler crab studies. For this we searched papers available in the Thomson ISI database that contained the words "Uca" OR "fiddler* crab*" between the years 1991 and 2007. For each paper, we researched and recorded the following characteristics: publication year; journal of publication; the first author's nationality; the country where the study was conducted; study type; species studied; and the work area. Our results indicated that there was no increase in the number of articles through the years considered. The Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology published most of the articles on Uca, indicating the importance of this group as a model for testing ecological hypotheses using experimental approaches. Our results also showed that United States had the highest number of authors and published studies on Uca, following the overall trend in dominance on scientific research. Furthermore, using models with three variables (per capita income, number of species of Uca and extent of coastal countries) we observed that, according to the Akaike Information Criterion, the per capita income was the most important correlate for the number of articles per country (both the author's country and country of study). Additionally, our results show that the species U. pugilator (distributed on the East Coast of the North American continent) was the species most singularly referenced in the papers considered. Moreover, our results indicate that most studies on Uca use a descriptive and local scale. The majority of papers in our literature search reflect studies in population biology, followed by behavioral and physiological characteristics.

AB  - Potential geographical distribution of American species of "fiddler crab" (Uca spp.) (Crustacea, Decapoda) based on ecological niche model. The genus Uca Leach, 1814 (fiddler-crabs) is a well-know group characterized by a marked sexual dimorphism. Worldwide, there are 97 species of fiddler crabs described. Here, we predicted the potential geographical distribution of four species of this genus (Uca maracoani Latreille, 1802-1803, U. uruguayensis Nobili, 1901, U. panacea Novak & Salmon, 1974 e U. monilifera Rathbun, 1914), which occur in the American continent coast. Data used in the modeling were compiled from occurrence records available in the literature. We used Maxent and GARP programs for modelling, 10 climatic variables and three topographical variables. All variables were converted to a grid resolution of 0.0417 degrees. In both Maxent and GARP models the predicted geographical distribution of the species was larger than suggested by other observed data works, except for U. monilifera. According to the AUC criterion, the models generated by GARP were better than those obtained from Maxent. Evaluating the two models together, it is recommended conservation plans for species with restricted habitat (U. panaceae and U. monilifera) besides suggesting sampling of U. maracoani in the Brazilian northeast and U. uruguyaensis in the Brazilian southeast.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the levels of phylogenetic heritability of the geographical range size, shape and position for 88 species of fiddler crabs of the world, using phylogenetic comparative methods and simulation procedures to evaluate their fit to the neutral model of Brownian motion. The geographical range maps were compiled from literature, and range size was based on the entire length of coastline occupied by each species, and the position of each range was calculated as its latitudinal and longitudinal midpoint. The range shape of each species was based in fractal dimension (box-counting technique). The evolutionary patterns in the geographical range metrics were explored by phylogenetic correlograms using Moran's I autocorrelation coefficients, autoregressive method (ARM) and phylogenetic eigenvector regression (PVR). The correlograms were compared with those obtained by simulations of Brownian motion processes across phylogenies. The distribution of geographical range size of fiddler crabs is right-skewed and weak phylogenetic autocorrelation was observed. On the other hand, there was a strong phylogenetic pattern in the position of the range (mainly along longitudinal axis). Indeed, the ARM and PVR evidenced, respectively, that ca. 86% and 91% of the longitudinal midpoint could be explained by phylogenetic relationships among the species. The strong longitudinal phylogenetic pattern may be due to vicariant allopatric speciation and geographically structured cladogenesis in the group. The traits analysed (geographical range size and position) did not follow a Brownian motion process, thus suggesting that both adaptive ecological and evolutionary processes must be invoked to explain their dynamics, not following a simple neutral inheritance in the fiddler-crab evolution.

AB  - A total of 150 species belonging to five infraorders (Caridea, Stenopodidea, Thalassinidea, Anomura and Brachyura) are recorded from the Iranian coast of the Persian Gulf. About 17% (26 species) are new records for the area. The infraorder Brachyura shows the highest species richness with 83 species. The Anomura and Caridea, with 29 and 27 species, respectively, follow. The Thalassinidea is represented by 10 species, whereas Stenopodidea only by one. The species with the highest occurence are ranked as follows: Nanosesarma sarii Naderloo & Turkay, 2009 (Brachyura), Alpheus lobidens De Haan, 1850 (Caridea), Metopograpsus messor (Forskal, 1775) (Brachyura), Coenobita scaevola (Forskal, 1775) (Anomura), Diogenes avarus Heller, 1865 (Anomura), Pilumnopeus convexus Maccagno, 1936 (Brachyura) and Portunus segnis (Forskal, 1775) (Brachyura). Among the surveyed habitats, mixed rocky/cobble show the highest diversity with 99 (66%) recorded species, followed by sedimentary muddy-sandy substrates and mangroves with 40 (26%) and 24 species (16%), respectively. The least diverse habitat is sandy beaches with 6 species. The decapod fauna shows a predominance of wide ranging Indo-West Pacific species (43%) and a small degree of endemism (5%). A considerable number of species is restricted to the northwestern Indian Ocean (27%), supporting the presence of a zoogeographical subregion within the western Indian Ocean Province.

AB  - The possibility that methionine-enkephalin induces hyperglycemia in the fiddler crab, Uca lactea annulipes was investigated. Injection of methionine-enkephalin and FK 33824 (methionine-enkephalin agonist) resulted in significant hyperglycemia in intact crabs but not in eyestalkless crabs. In contrast, naloxone (methionine-enkephalin receptor blocker) significantly (P < 0.0001) decreased hemolymph sugar level in intact crabs. This hyperglycemic action of methionine- enkephalin is hypothesized to be indirect, triggering release of hyperglycemic hormone from the eyestalks of the crabs.

AB  - Some fiddler crab species (genus Uca) are known to mate either on the surface or underground. Here we describe these two modes of mating in Uca lactea perplexa and compare them with these mating modes in other ocypodid crabs. All surface matings, which lasted from 1.2-5.1 min, occurred near the burrow entrance of the female. There was a weak, but significant, positive correlation between the sizes of surface-mating males and females. About 65% (44/68 pairs) of the males were larger, and 32% (22/68) smaller than their mates. Four of 36 (11%) females that were collected after surface mating and held in the laboratory ovulated fertile clutches. Females mated underground after they left their own burrows and either preceded or followed courting males into their burrows where they stayed, mated, and ovulated a clutch of eggs. Males significantly more often attempted to attract females to follow (67/75 courtships, 89%) rather than precede (8/75, 11%) them into their burrows, and relatively more of 44 females that mated in burrows of males followed (64%) than preceded (36%) their mates underground. However, this difference between the relative frequencies of the two kinds of courtship and their success suggests that females are more likely to mate in burrows that they enter first. All females that mated underground ovulated fertile clutches. Although individual males attempted both surface and underground mating, males that mated underground were larger than those that surface-mated. Unlike surface matings, they also were larger than their mates. The two different modes of mating, and sequences that lead to underground mating in U. lactea perplexa, are found in related ocypodid crabs, but the conditions governing their use are not yet clear.

AB  - b-Pigment-dispersing (beta-PDH) isolated from the fiddler crab (Rao et al., '85) is a member of an octadecapeptide family of neuropeptides common to arthropods. Whereas earlier studies of these peptides in insects were limited to orthopterans, this investigation focuses on dipteran flies. Extracts of heads from the blowfly Phormia terraenovae were assessed in a fiddler crab bioassay for PDH activity. Immunocytochemistry, dose-response curves, gel filtration chromatography and reversed-phase HPLC, combined with bioassay and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), indicate the presence of PDH-like peptide in the blowfly. Immunocytochemical mapping of PDH-like immunoreactive (PDHLI) neurons was performed for the entire nervous systems of Phormia and the fruitfly Drosophila with a beta-PDH antiserum. In the cephalic ganglion (brain, optic lobe and subesophageal ganglion) PDHLI cell bodies could be detected (34 in Phormia and 16 in Drosophila). In both species, each hemisphere contains 8 PDHLI cell bodies in the optic lobes. These innervate the optic lobe neurophils bilaterally. In Phormia, another set of 8 cell bodies are located in each of the lateral neurosecretory cell groups in the superior protocerebrum. Three neurons send axons to the corpora cardiac-hypocerebral ganglion complex and to portions of the foregut. In contrast, only the optic lobe neurons display immunoreactivity in Drosophila. Except for the optic lobes, PDHLI processes are distributed only in nonglomerular neuropils of the brain of both species. In the fused thoracicoabdominal ganglia of Phormia, 28 PDHLI cell bodies were found (only six were found in Drosophila). In both species, six abdominal PDHLI neurons are efferents with axons innervating the hindgut. We also found that some of the PDHLI neurons in the Phormia brain and abdominal ganglion contain colocalized FMRFamide-like immunoreactivity.

AB  - The pigment-dispersing hormone (PDH) family of neuropeptides comprises a series of closely related octadecapeptides, isolated from different species of crustaceans and insects, which can be demonstrated immunocytochemically in neurons in the central nervous system and optic lobes of some representatives of these groups (Rao and Riehm 1989). In this investigation we have extended these immunocytochemical studies to include the blowfly Phormia terraenovae and the cockroach Leucophaea maderae. In the former species tissue extracts were also tested in a bioassay: extracts of blowfly brains exhibited PDH-like biological activity, causing melanophore pigment dispersion in destalked (eyestalkless) specimens of the fiddler crab Uca pugilator. Using standard immunocytochemical techniques, we could demonstrate a small number of pigment-dispersing hormone-immunoreactive (PDH-IR) neurons innervating optic lobe neuropil in the blowfly and the cockroach. In the blowfly the cell bodies of these neurons are located at the anterior base of the medulla. At least eight PDH-IR cell bodies of two size classes can be distinguished: 4 larger and 4 smaller. Branching immunoreactive fibers invade three layers in the medulla neuropil, and one stratum distal and one proximal to the lamina synaptic layer. A few fibers can also be seen invading the basal lobula and the lobula plate. The fibers distal to the lamina appear to be derived from two of the large PDH-IR cell bodies which also send processes into the medulla. These neurons share many features in their lamina-medulla morphology with the serotonin immunoreactive neurons LBO-5HT described earlier (see Nassel 1988). It could be demonstrated by immunocytochemical double labeling that the serotonin and PDH immunoreactivities are located in two separate sets of neurons. In the cockroach optic lobe PDH-IR processes were found to invade the lamina synaptic region and form a diffuse distribution in the medulla. The numerous cell bodies of the lamina-medulla cells in the cockroach are located basal to the lamina in two clusters. Additional PDH-IR cell bodies could be found at the anterior base of the medulla. The distribution and morphology of serotonin-immunoreactive neurons in the cockroach lamina was found to be very similar to the PDH-IR ones. It is hence tempting to speculate that in both species the PDH-and serotonin-immunoreactive neurons are functionally coupled with common follower neurons. These neurons may be candidates for regulating large numbers of units in the visual system. In the flies photoreceptor properties may be regulated by action of the two set of neurons at sites peripheral to the lamina synaptic layer, possibly by paracrine release of messengers.

AB  - To understand the population dynamics of meroplanktonic species, it is crucial to analyze the factors that affect the dispersal of planktonic larval forms. Physical and biological processes act on a wide range of spatial and temporal scales to disperse and congregate larvae. To ascertain which processes influence larval dispersal most significantly, one must first resolve the spatial and temporal scales of larval patches. In this dissertation I describe research that assessed the spatial and temporal scales of patches of larval blue crabs ( Callinectes sapidus ) and post-larval fiddler crabs (Uca spp .) in the coastal waters of the Middle Atlantic Bight. Specifically, my work comprised the following four components: (1) assessing larval distribution on a broad (104 m) spatial scale; (2) determining larval patchiness on fine spatial and temporal scale (102 -10 4 m; 1-6 d); (3) extending the temporal scale by tagging and tracking larval patches in real-time; and (4) assessing post-larval patchiness on a broad (104 m) spatial scale. By analyzing numerous series of plankton tows, I demonstrated that C sapidus larvae are distributed in patches on both broad (104 in) and fine (102 -104 in) spatial scales. Additionally, by tagging and following zoeal patches with satellite-tracked drifters, and subsequently analyzing the relative proportion of zoeal stages composing the tagged patches, I showed that zoea larvae have the propensity to remain in cohesive patches for periods of several days. Finally, by analyzing daily post-larval collections from two stations separated by 20 km, I demonstrated broad-scale (>10 4 m) patchiness of decapod (Uca ) post-larvae. This formal description of the size and duration of decapod larval patches can focus future studies of crab larval transport by directing research to those physical and biological transport processes that act at the appropriate spatial and temporal scales.

AB  - The relative growth of U. thayeri was studied for a subtropical mangrove population in the estuary of the Comprido and Escuro rivers, Ubatuba, Sao Paulo State, Brazil. The evaluation of the morphological sexual maturity of U. thayeri was performed using the allometric technique. Remarkable ontogenetic changes were observed in the allometric growth of the male major cheliped and the female abdomen, indicating that these structures are closely connected to the timing of sexual maturity. For males, the relative-growth analysis of cheliped propodus length rendered an estimate of 13.8 mm of carapace width for the size at onset of sexual maturity. A distinct growth pattern was observed for the abdomen of U. thayeri females. It has a wide puberty size range (from 10.7 to 16.8 mm of CW) compared to other brachyurans previously studied. Thus, the females' abdominal growth can be represented by three growth phases: immature, transitional, and mature. The major cheliped is the fight one in 50% of males. The median length of the male major cheliped did not differ between right- and left-handed crabs.

AB  - Odn the Brazilian coast, ten species of fiddler crabs occur in the estuaries and mangrove systems. The larval development of only five of these species is completely known. Here we describe the first zoeal stage and megalopa of Uca (Uca s. str.) maracoani. Ovigerous females and megalopae were obtained at Jabaquara Beach, Paraty, state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The first zoeal stage was obtained from ovigerous females in the laboratory, and the megalopae directly from the field. Both zoeae and megalopae were raised in laboratory conditions. The megalopae survived until the eighth juvenile stage, when they could be identified to species. The larval morphology was analyzed and compared with the species already known for the Brazilian coast, and some other species, such as the southeast Atlantic fiddler crab, Uca tangeri. The comparison showed that U. maracoani has some characteristics that are more similar to U. tangeri than the previously studied species from the Brazilian coast. This is the first description of the zoea and megalopa morphology of a member of the genus Uca from the southwest Atlantic, of which the adult has a narrow front sensu Crane (1975), and it is helpful for taxonomic, systematic and ecological purposes.

AB  - This paper characterizes the modern Psilonichnus ichnocoenosis present in the seaward side of Peixe Lagoon (southernmost Brazil) and discusses its preservation potential in the fossil record and its (paleo)environmental and stratigraphic significances. This ichnofauna occurs in exposed softgrounds and stiffgrounds of the backshore and backbarrier environments associated with the channel mouth area of the lagoon. The burrow assemblage is composed of Y- and J-shaped dwelling burrows and trackways of grapsid crabs (Chasmagnatus granulata), fiddler crabs (Uca uruguayensis), and ocypodid crabs (Ocypode quadrata), tracks and trackways of scarab beetles, birds, and small lizards, horizontal, randomly branched, shallow feeding burrows of mole crickets, dwelling burrows of small rodents and ant nests. As a natural park, most of the natural environmental conditions that support the establishment of such an ichnocoenosis are preserved in the study area, favoring its use as a modern analogue to the ancient Psilonichnus Ichnofacies. Thus, original concepts developed after the first record of the Psilonichnus ichnocoenosis in modern environments, which supported the construction of the Psilonichnus Ichnofacies paradigm, are revisited herein and some premises are reinforced. Possible stratigraphic scenarios are also estimated, allowing the inference that the best preservation of the Psilonichnus Ichnofacies occurs during the establishment of transgressive system tracts.

AB  - The macrobenthos of mangroves is dominated by crabs and molluscs, which have a significant ecological role in terms of the structure and function of mangroves. The aim of this study was to determine the abundance and biological diversity of these groups in the Wouri River estuary mangrove in Douala, Cameroon. Three methods of crabs capture (excavation, sight harvest and visual count) were used in 10 x 10 m(2) plots for the crabs and quadrats of 1 x 1 m(2) were employed for mollusc counts. In all, 24 species, evenly distributed between the two groups, were collected. Five families of crabs and six families of molluscs were identified. Sesarmidae (eight species) and Pachymelaniidae (four species) were best represented in terms of species richness, whereas Sesarmidae (94.6%) and Potamididae (45.6%) were the most abundant taxa. The inventory of macrobenthos of mangroves in Cameroon currently consists of 60 species, including nine (three crabs and six of molluscs) reported from this study.

AB  - Cystacanths of Hexaglandula corynosoma were discovered in the fiddler crabs Uca spinicarpa and Uca rapax collected in Mississippi and Florida. Adults were present in yellow-crowned night herons, Nyctanassa violacea, collected in Florida, Cystacanths are very similar to adults, varying only in size and state of development. This is the first record of H. corynosoma from the United States and the first record of an intermediate host for any species of the genus. Cystacanths of Arhythmorhynchus frassoni were present in (, rapax from Florida. The proboscis size, shape, and armature of the cystacanths are identical to those of adults from clapper rails (Rallus longirostris) collected in several southeastern states. This is the first report of an intermediate host for A. frassoni. Profilicollis altmani cystacanths were collected from mole crabs (Emerita talpoida) at Atlantic Beach, North Carolina. These specimens, together with adults obtained from shore birds in Louisiana and Mississippi, are consistent with the view that P. altmani, Profilicollis kenti, and Profilicollis texensis are synonyms, with P, altmani having nomenclatural priority.

AB  - The impact of fiddler crabs (Uca spp.) on benthic mineralization rates and pathways in deposits of shrimp pond waste (SPW) with planted mangrove trees (Rhizophora apiculata) were determined in the Ranong mangrove forest, Thailand. Sediment metabolism, measured as CO2 flux, increased by 2- to 3-fold when either fiddler crabs or mangrove trees were present compared to control plots. Sulfate reduction rates (SRR) were always high and partitioning of various electron acceptors to total carbon oxidation revealed that sulfate reduction contributed by >90%, with iron reduction being important only near the sediment-water interface. However, significant iron reduction appeared down to 7 cm when bioturbation and plant roots were combined in the easily oxidizable mangrove sediment (MS), indicating that infaunal activity and plant roots were able to alter the substratum. Microprofiles around individual Uca burrows showed 46% lower SRRs in a 15-mm-thick oxidized layer around the burrows compared to the surrounding sediment. The burrow wall environment appears to be a zone of intense reoxidation of reduced compounds as indicated by low pools of reduced sulfide compounds and a high Fe(III) content. Despite the decreased SRRs near the burrow, and the introduction of Fe(III) to deeper sediment layers, fiddler crabs and mangrove trees have only limited impact on rates and partitioning of anaerobic carbon mineralization in the SPW. This lack of response was attributed to the relative small volume of sediment affected by crab activities. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The aquatic herbicide Rodeo is used to kill weeds and marsh grasses such as the invasive common reed Phragmites australis and the cord grass Spartina alterniflora. Since there are many different species of animals living in areas where it is applied, Roundup, a Rodeo analog that is readily obtainable, was tested to determine its effects on the ribbed mussel, Geukensia demissa, and the fiddler crab, Uca pugnax. The mean number of mussels that survived in 0.3125, 0.625, 1.25, 2.5, 5, and 10% Roundup after 3-5 days was 0. The mean number of crabs that survived in 5 and 10% Roundup after 3-5 days was significantly different from the control. In another experiment that tested crab feeding, 10-1 M glucose induced the highest number of feeding motions. To determine if Roundup had an effect on the number of crab feeding motions at this glucose concentration, triplicate finger bowls were filled with seawater, 10-1 M glucose, and 10-1 M glucose with 5% Roundup. The decrease in feeding in the 5% Roundup mixture was not significantly different from 10-1 M glucose and the control. The experiments showed that mussels were more sensitive to Roundup than crabs. Roundup should only be used at the lowest doses possible (<0.3125%), especially if mussels inhabit or can inhabit areas where Roundup is applied.

AB  - In the mid-upper intertidal zone of Australian mangrove communities, Uca flammula (Crane), Uca signata (Hess) and Uca elegans (George and Jones) live in forest, edge and clearing habitats, respectively, and sesarmids are abundant in forest habitats. To examine why some species associate with, while others avoid vegetated habitats, three physical features that create spatial variation in vegetation cover were experimentally decoupled in the field: i.e. (1) shade cover, (2) above-ground structure and (3) below ground structure. Shade, but not above or below ground structure, significantly affected crab counts. Uca signata, U flammula and sesarmids invaded shaded treatments; U. elegans avoided them. This suggests that vegetation does not provide structural support for crab burrows or a refuge from predators. Compared to the other species, U. elegans most often employs visual signals and may avoid vegetated habitats because they hinder visibility. The other crabs may benefit from the less stressful conditions found under plant cover as shaded plots were wetter and cooler than exposed plots. Sesarmids may have positive and negative effects on Uca distribution because they harass and sometimes kill Uca, yet their burrowing and feeding activities may have numerous benefits such as enriching the soil. Uca elegans, and possibly U. signata, may avoid living within forests because their waving behaviour during mating makes them conspicuous to predators. The loss of visual signals to attract females may enable U flammula to successfully co-habitat with sesarmids. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Counting the number of individuals emerging from burrows is the most practical method for estimating the apparent abundance of Australian Uca species living in mangrove habitats. Experiments were conducted to investigate the effect on counts of quadrat design, distance of observer, quadrat size, recovery time and observational technique. Significant differences in the apparent abundance of one species were found when the subjects were within 2 m of the observer, and when a conspicuous quadrat was used. The largest quadrat tested provided the least variability in counts but an intermediate size (0.56 m(2)) was more practical. Most Uca active within a 30-min period emerged during the first 10 min regardless of site, species, sex or season. There was a linear correlation between scanning and continuous observation indicating that the former method could be useful when sampling time was limited. Temporal changes in the apparent abundance of Uca suggest that long-term sampling and more detailed studies will be worthwhile.

AB  - Abiotic conditions often change ecological interactions. Studies in areas with low to moderate soil salinities have demonstrated a facultative mutualism between fiddler crabs and salt marsh vegetation. In these habitats, fiddler crab burrowing increases plant growth, and plant roots help support the walls of crab burrows. We looked for these interactions in hypersaline soils bordering unvegetated salt pans in a Georgia salt marsh. Crab burrows and vegetation cover were positively associated. Neither crab removals nor burrow additions demonstrated a positive effect of crabs on vegetation. However, both vegetation removals and the addition of an artificial canopy (suspended shadecloth) demonstrated a strong positive effect of vegetation on crab burrows. In contrast to previous studies, we found no evidence that plants supported burrow walls. Instead, crabs likely associate with vegetation to avoid predators. Our results caution against extrapolating experimental results between habitats with different abiotic conditions.

AB  - This study examined settlement and recruitment of two species of fiddler crab, Uca pugilator (Bosc, 1820) and U. pugnax (Smith, 1870), that occupy different zones in salt marshes as adults. The major objective was to assess whether processes that are known to influence settlement and recruitment of sessile and sedentary species of benthic marine invertebrates also are important for these motile animals. A method to differentiate between juveniles of the two species was developed. By rearing larvae from eggs through the first several crab instars, I found that juveniles of the two species could be distinguished morphologically by the time they reached 3-4 mm carapace width: Uca pugilator possessed up to 10 spoon-tipped setae on the meropodite of the second maxilliped, whereas U. pugnax almost always had none. To assess whether movement after larval settlement was important in determining spatial patterns of adults, I documented the distribution and abundance patterns of larval, juvenile, and adult crabs along an intertidal gradient in the field. The two species differed in spatial pattern, and within a species the three stages exhibited similar zonation patterns: larvae settled in habitats with conspecific juveniles and adults. I hypothesized that if larvae choose to settle in adult habitats, they should be able to adjust the timing of metamorphosis when specific habitat cues were presented or withheld. Under controlled laboratory conditions, Uca pugilator larvae (megalopae) were able to delay metamorphosis when two cues, sediment and an adult conspecific, were absent, and could accelerate metamorphosis in the presence of both cues. The growth rate of adult crabs is related to the amount of nitrogen in the diet. By cannibalizing young conspecifics, adults would obtain a food source high in nitrogen content while decreasing recruitment to the population. In the laboratory, adults consistently ate a high proportion of megalopae, but ate fewer juvenile crabs when physical structure (lumps of mud, or straws simulating marsh grass) was present. This suggests that juveniles have a refuge from predation by adults in the field.

AB  - The larvae of many invertebrate taxa can delay metamorphosis for considerable periods of time in the absence of specific stimuli for settlement. This study tested the hypothesis that the duration of the megalopal stage of fiddler crabs can be adjusted by several days depending on the availability of some habitat components. The hypothesis that megalopae can delay the metamorphic molt was tested by comparing the proportion of individuals molting to the first crab instar in aquaria containing only filtered seawater to that in aquaria with mud, sand, and/or an adult crab, near the predicted time of molting. The hypothesis that molting can be advanced was tested by comparing the proportion of sibling larvae molting at intervals throughout the megalopal stage in aquaria containing only filtered seawater or seawater plus an adult crab, mud, and sand. Megalopae delayed molting unless 2 stimuli were present: an adult crab and sediment, either mud or sand. The metamorphic molt was advanced in the presence of both these cues, although contact with the sediment by the adult crab appears necessary for maximal effect. Flexibility in timing of molting and the requirement for more than one cue can increase the chance that megalopae settle and molt to the first crab instar in appropriate adult habitats.

AB  - Changes in body chemical composition were compared among groups of fiddler crabs (Uca pugilator and U. pugnax) freshly collected from the field or offered diets containing various amounts of nitrogen in the laboratory. Specific growth rates of experimental crabs were calculated based on estimated changes in total body nitrogen during the experiment. Crabs offered a diet enriched in nitrogen (casein) had higher organic contents (mg ash-free dry weight.g DW-1) than either crabs offered a non-supplemented diet or field-caught conspecifics. A positive relationship between specific growth rate and organic content, based on the amount of nitrogen in the diet, was found for crabs in the laboratory. A comparison of values of organic content of field-caught crabs with those of crabs offered the diet supplemented with nitrogen suggests that U. pugilator and U. pugnax do not grow at maximal rates in nature.

AB  - Where larvae settle often is critical for determining the distribution and abundance patterns of later stages of sessile and sedentary marine invertebrates. However, selection of adult habitat by larvae at settlement might be less crucial for invertebrates that have motile benthic stages and have the option of further habitat selection after settlement. If movement after settlement is important in determining spatial patterns of later stages of motile invertebrates, then the distribution and abundance patterns of settling larvae will differ from those of older conspecifics. I tested this hypothesis by documenting the distribution and abundance patterns of settling larvae, juveniles, and adults of the fiddler crabs Uca pugilator and U. pugnax along an intertidal gradient in a North Carolina, USA, salt marsh. Benthic distribution and abundance patterns of conspecific settlers (megalopae and newly-metamorphosed crabs), juveniles, and adult crabs were very similar, but the 2 species generally were spatially separated in the marsh even at the earliest life stage. U. pugilator occupied the edge of the marsh next to a tidal creek, whereas U. pugnax was most abundant at higher marsh elevations. Because larvae settled in areas with older conspecifics, and the distribution and abundance patterns established at settlement were maintained throughout benthic life, post-settlement movement along a vertical gradient is not important in establishing where adults of these motile benthic species live.

AB  - Larvae of many benthic invertebrates metamorphose in response to habitat cues, which include the presence of adult conspecifics. Prior research showed that fiddler crab [Uca pugnax (Smith)] megalopae advance molting to the first crab stage in seawater in which conspecific adult crabs were maintained. In the present study, extracts of adult crabs were prepared and the specificity and protein content were characterized. U. pugnax megalopae were reared in the laboratory to minimize their prior exposure to potential molting cues. Then they were presented with extract solutions (in 1995, 1996, 1997, and 2000) to determine the specificity of the molting response to extracts of several crab species and the effects of the protein concentration of the extract, age of the megalopae at exposure to extract, and the duration of exposure on the molting response. Megalopae of U. pugnax molted sooner in seawater containing extract from adult conspecifics than in filtered seawater without extract or in seawater containing extract from the congener U. minax. Extract from the mud crab Dyspanopeus sayi retarded molting of U. pugnax megalopae. The stimulatory effect of U. pugnax extract on molting of megalopae was dependent on extract concentration. U. pugnax megalopae did not respond to extract until 6 days after molting, and only 1 day of exposure was sufficient to stimulate molting. The boiled extract was effective after being frozen (-15degreesC) for 2 years. The preparation of stable extract provides a uniform stimulus for multiple experiments examining the specificity of molting cues for brachyuran crustacean larvae and the onset of receptivity to cues.

AB  - Larvae of many benthic invertebrates respond to particular habitat cues during settlement and metamorphosis. We used laboratory-reared larvae of the salt-marsh fiddler crab Uca pugnax to test whether various cues influenced the duration of the megalopal (presettlement) stage. Filtered natural sea water conditioned by an adult crab for 24 h significantly (P = 0.0001) shortened the megalopal stage by 1-2 days compared to control filtered sea water, but adult-conditioned silt sized glass beads had no effect on megalopal duration (P = 0.303). The megalopal stage was significantly (P = 0.04) shortened for megalopae that were not exposed to adult-conditioned sea water until 6 days after molting to megalopa, but not for megalopae that were 8 or 10 days postmolt when first exposed to the adult-conditioned sea water. Uca minax-conditioned sea water and Spartina alterniflora-conditioned sea water did not affect the duration of the megalopal stage of U, pugnax. It appears that megalopae of U. pugnax respond physiologically (by molting) to sea water containing substances released by adult conspecifics.

AB  - Rather than relying on chance delivery of larvae to experimental field substrata, we developed a field caging method to expose lab-reared crab megalopae to natural cues that could affect timing of molting to the first crab stage. Uca pugnax megalopae were placed in plastic mesh cages containing freshly collected sediments from a marsh occupied by U. pugnax, or similar sediments that had been combusted to remove organic material. Cages of each sediment type were placed at identical tidal elevations in a Spartina alterniflora marsh for 1 or 3 d of exposure to natural seawater. Significantly more megalopae molted in cages containing fresh than combusted marsh sediments (90% vs 32%, ANOVA F-1,F-8 = 53.95, p < 0.001) after a 3 d period of exposure. Three days after the 1 d exposure period, nearly all megalopae from cages of both sediment types had molted. Furthermore, all sibling megalopae remaining in the lab during the field experiment failed to molt. High rates of molting of megalopae caged in the marsh with natural and combusted sediments indicate that chemical substances both in the water overlying the marsh and associated with marsh sediments stimulated molting of megalopae.

AB  - Most marine benthic invertebrates possess complex life histories that involve a planktonic larval stage that must seek the proper adult habitat. For practical reasons, the search for cues that stimulate settlement and metamorphosis to the benthic stage have traditionally utilized either laboratory studies or field correlations between larval and adult distributions. In contrast, we have developed an in situ technique that employs lab-reared fiddler crab Uca pugnax larvae placed in mesh cages in realistic estuarine settings to address the roles of potential adult habitat cues for molting. We extended our prior work to examine the influence of sediment type on molting of megalopae. In addition, we manipulated the duration of field exposure of megalopae to cues. In 2 series of experiments (1996 and 1997), we examined the importance of the nature of cues (waterborne vs sediment), habitat (sandflat vs salt marsh), duration of exposure to field cues (1 vs 3 d), and field test site (different marshes within an estuary). Freshly collected marsh sediment stimulated molting to the benthic first crab stage, whereas fresh sand did not. Contact with natural seawater overlying a marsh also stimulated molting compared to control megalopae in filtered seawater in the lab or field. Moreover, the response appeared additive: the highest molting rates were observed when megalopae were exposed to both marsh sediment and seawater. Cages on the sandflat remained intact but filled with sediment, and almost all megalopae died before molting. Three days of field exposure to marsh sediments and seawater had a greater effect on molting than 1 d of exposure, although megalopae were stimulated to molt following only the 1 d exposure period. In addition, results were consistent in marshes that differed in sediment particle size. Consistency in response among years and between marsh sites suggests a strong response of fiddler crab megalopae to natural marsh ecosystems.

AB  - Waterborne chemicals can be habitat cues for pelagic larvae of benthic invertebrates by stimulating settlement and metamorphosis, Less clear is whether cue effectiveness declines with increasing distance from the source. We examined whether the ability of seawater to stimulate metamorphosis (molting) of fiddler crab Uca minax megalopae to the first-crab stage is restricted to water overlying marshes. Laboratory-reared megalopae were enclosed in situ for 3 d within nylon mesh cages in both a marsh and a river site 15 m away from the marsh. Even in the absence of contact with sediment, megalopae in the marsh had high rates of molting, whereas those in the river molted at very low rates similar to control megalopae enclosed in glass jars containing filtered seawater and deployed in the marsh habitat. In a second experiment, we tested for a dose-dependent molting response from the presumed source of the cue. We hypothesized a negative linear relationship in molting frequency with increasing distance from the marsh. Megalopae were enclosed for 3 d in cages within the marsh and at distances of 2, 5, and 15 m away from the marsh edge, and in jars within the marsh. Molting response was greatest in the marsh, intermediate 2 and 5 m away from the marsh, and lowest 15 m from the marsh and in the control jars (test of regression slope, F-1,F-25 = 13.290, p = 0.001, r(2) = 0.321). Therefore, chemical cues for molting of fiddler crab megalopae originate in marshes and decline in effectiveness within a short (<15 m) distance of the marsh habitat.

AB  - Planktonic larvae of many benthic taxa settle and metamorphose in response to certain habitat cues. Although laboratory investigations of the importance of potential cues are numerous, field experiments are less common. We modified a field caging technique first developed for analysis of molting specificity of fiddler crab megalopae to test potential habitat cues affecting molting of megalopae of the non-native Asian shore crab Hemigrapsus sanguineus (de Haan). Potential cues consisted of waterborne substances from 2 potential habitats (cobble beach and salt marsh), and the material used to construct experimental cages. Experiments were conducted in 2002, 2003, and 2004 in Massachusetts and New York (USA). Megalopae (4 or 5 d post molt) were placed in either nylon mesh (500 mu m) cages open to flooding seawater or transparent glass jars containing filtered seawater. Cages and jars were placed at identical intertidal heights at the field sites and retrieved 3 or 4 d later. The proportion of megalopae molting to the first crab stage was determined after the period of field exposure and for 2 d thereafter. More megalopae molted in cages than jars placed in the adult habitat (cobble beach) and in a marsh without adults. The cage mesh had little effect on molting response. We conclude that waterborne cues stimulate molting of H. sanguineus megalopae, and that cues are present in both the adult habitat and marsh. Molting of H. sanguineus megalopae is substantially less habitat-specific than molting of native fiddler crab megalopae. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Adult-associated chemical cues can stimulate settlement and metamorphosis of invertebrate larvae into habitats with an enhanced likelihood of juvenile and adult survival. For example, sediments from adult fiddler crab habitat stimulate fiddler crab megalopae to metamorphose (molt) sooner than sediments without adult cues. A similar stimulation of molting occurs after exposure to waterborne chemical cues from adult habitats and to exudates and extracts of adult crabs. We tested whether sediments from habitats without adult Uca pugnax (Smith), which do not stimulate molting of their megalopae, could become stimulatory through brief exposure to adult crabs. Sediments were collected from tidal flats at several distances (similar to 1 m, similar to 50 m, and similar to 5.4 km) from adult habitats, and incubated for 24 h with or without adult crabs. Molting rates of laboratory-reared megalopae exposed for 48 h to adult-conditioned sediments were compared to those for untreated controls. Sediments collected in or within I m of adult habitat elicited the highest molting rates, and natural sediments from 50 m and 5.4 km had little or no effect on molting. However, incubating sediments collected away from adult habitat with adult crabs produced a higher molting response, and the magnitude of the enhancement increased with distance from adult habitat. Results suggest that the chemical cues that adult crabs release are retained by sediments and consequently stimulate molting of megalopae, regardless of the nature of the sediments themselves. Lack of chemical cues may retard colonization of newly created or heavily disturbed habitats that are otherwise suitable settlement and adult habitat. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Planktonic larvae of estuarine species often develop in the coastal ocean and return to estuaries using favorable currents. This study investigated spatial distributions of brachyuran crab post-larvae during ingress to the Newport River estuary, North Carolina, USA (34A degrees 41' N, 76A degrees 40' W). Nearshore plankton tows were conducted across the inlet to the estuary. Settlement on passive 'hog's hair' collectors was simultaneously monitored in each of four estuarine channels. Callinectes sapidus density was highest east of the inlet, whereas relative estuarine abundance was higher in western channels. In separate sampling with collectors at coastal and estuarine locations, spatial distributions of post-larvae were consistent through time but differed for C. sapidus, Uca spp., and Pachygrapsus transversus. The diel timing of C. sapidus settlement on collectors was determined at the coast and compared to previous studies of settlement in the estuary. Behavioral responses to environmental cues may alter transport pathways from those predicted by hydrodynamic models.

AB  - Many kinds of benthic organisms in tidal flats are considered to be involved in the purification of organic load. Among them, ocypodid crabs are expected to play an important role due to their high population density in sandy tidal flats. We estimated the organic ingestion of the crabs in Hitotsuba Lagoon within Miyazaki Port in all seasons throughout the year of 2003. Three dominant species, Uca lactea, Ilyoplax pusilla, and Scopimera globosa, and their feeding pellets were collected by quantitative methods. Their habitats were 3500, 1500 and 20750-26750 m(2), respectively. The maximum accumulations of their feeding pellets were 944, 486 and 2266 g m(-2) d(-1), respectively. The original bottom sediments contained organic matter of less than 5.0 mg Cg(-1) and 0.5 mg Ng(-1), and the loss compared to the feeding pellets was 5-80%. These three species ingested 3.36, 0.18 and 1.67 g Cm-2 d(-1), 0.416, 0.024 and 0.086 g Nm(-2) d(-1) from the bottom sediments, respectively. Their total ingestion was estimated to be about 13 kg Cd-1 and 1.4 kg Nd-1 in this lagoon, which might be equivalent to 7% of the organic load from outside of the lagoon.

AB  - During the past three decades a considerable number of studies have been conducted to reveal effects of macrofauna on meiofaunal assemblages in marine soft-bottoms. The aim of this review is to compile and summarize major findings of studies that have experimentally tested if a given macrofauna species affects some aspect of a meiobenthic assemblage. Altogether 77 studies on 44 macrofaunal species are reviewed. The bulk of the macrofaunal species are conspicuous members of the phyla Crustacea, Annelida and Mollusca, namely 20, 9 and 8 species respectively. Almost all the studies (86%) investigating biogenic structures of macrobenthos indicate some sort of effects on meiofaunal assemblages. Those studies in which diversity of a particular animal group has been considered, almost all agree on enhanced species diversity as a result of biogenic structures. The results of studies that have considered overall effects of macrofauna originating from processes such as predation, physical disturbance, competition for food and biogenic structures also indicate effects on meiobenthos. In only a few studies, researchers have used 3 or more density levels of disturbing macrofauna in their experimental manipulations, including natural levels, for the understanding of ecological rules behind biological disturbances. As biological disturbance created by macrofauna is incredibly variable among species and difficult to rate or categorise, it seems as yet difficult to apply theories to macrofaunal disturbance in general, predicting diversity or abundance patterns in meiofaunal assemblages.

AB  - A survey was conducted to examine spatial variations in the population density of major meiofaunal taxa and the assemblage structure of free-living marine nematodes within 5 mangrove areas on the west and east coast of Zanzibar. Meiofauna densities in surface sediments (0-5 cm) ranged from 205 to 5263 ind. 10 cm-2, being on average 1493 ind. 10 cm-2. Of the 17 major taxa recorded, nematodes dominated (64-99%) in all samples while harpacticoid copepods were usually second most abundant. Within all areas the numbers of meiofauna were very variable and significant differences among areas were only detected for oligochaetes and turbellarians. Densities of nematodes, harpacticoids, polychaetes and turbellarians were, however, significantly (P lt 0.001) higher at low water stations compared with mid and high water stations. Harpacticoids were negatively correlated with the numbers of fiddler crab (Uca spp.) burrows. Other correlations between environmental factors (grain size, temperature, salinity, oxygen tension, prop root density, fiddler crab burrows) and major meiofaunal taxa were non-significant. A total of 94 nematode genera were recorded from four mangrove areas. The most abundant and frequent genera were Microlaimus and Spirinia, followed by Desmodora and Metachromadora. Representatives of the genera most common in current study are found all over the globe. There was a high variation in nematode assemblage structure within and between sampling areas indicating the absence of a well defined nematode assemblage confined to mangrove areas. In a hypersaline area diversity was much reduced and where salinity was over 100 permill the fauna was restricted to 3 nematode genera, Microlaimus, Theristus and Bathylaimus. Multidimensional scaling ordination (MDS) of the nematode genera separated samples taken from low water stations from other stations, the assemblage structure being significantly different at the low water stations.

AB  - To assess the effects of 2 mangrove crabs on benthic meiofauna a laboratory experiment was performed in Zanzibar, eastern Africa. The 2 ocypodidae crab species Uca annulipes and Dotilla fenestrata are commonly found at mid to high water levels among Avicennia marina trees. Both genera are borrowers in soft sediments and feed upon drained surface deposits by forming pseudofaecal pellets. They are efficient bioturbers of the uppermost few mm of the sediment and some Uca species may prey directly on meiobenthos. The 2 species were added to microcosms containing sediment with natural meiofauna populations. After 10 d of enclosure, numbers of harpacticoid copepods in the top 1 cm layer were significantly lower in microcosms containing U. annulipes than in control microcosms. Two nematode assemblages were found in the microcosms, one in the surface layer and one deeper down. The crabs did not alter the structure of these assemblages. It appears that the nematodes are quite resilient to the reworking of the sediment surface. We conclude that the ocypodid crabs do not regulate resident nematode assemblages, but may inhibit settlement of colonisers that have not adapted to the intense surface disturbance created by these crabs. Such biological control is most likely to be in those areas where tidal water contains relatively high numbers of migrating meiofauna.

AB  - Fiddler crabs present an accentuated sexual dimorphism wherein males have one of the chelipeds greatly enlarged, compared to the other chela or to the two small feeding chelipeds of females. Available observational data in the literature suggest a dual function for this trait both as an armament to fight other males and as an ornament to court females by claw waving. We experimentally tested female Uca tangeni for possible preferences based on the size and elevation (waving posture) of the male large cheliped and on male handedness. Dead, resin-coated males were used as test objects. Females significantly more often approached males with larger claws and males with raised claws. Male handedness had no effect on female responses. These results are consistent with a female mating preference based on claw size and position and hence with the evolution of claw size and the waving display as a result of sexual selection by female choice.

AB  - Male fiddler crabs have one of their feeding claws greatly enlarged, which may comprise up to 40% of their weight. In southern Portugal (Ria Formosa) the major claw of the fiddler crab Uca tangeri is a local delicacy. Fishermen break off the male major claw and throw the crab back into the mudflat to regenerate a new one. Approximately 38% of the males sampled had a missing or a regenerating claw. Although individuals are not removed from the population the operational sex ratio is biased towards females since other males and females behave towards clawless males as if they were females. Moreover, removing the major claw from males prevents them from signalling (waving display) to females to attract them to their breeding burrows and it also places them at a disadvantage if they have to defend their burrows from males with intact claws. Thus, the harvesting of male fiddler crab claws has potential consequences at the population level. In this paper we investigated these potential consequences by comparing an exploited population of fiddler crabs at Ria Formosa with a remote population at the Mira estuary that is not under human exploitation. The unexploited population has significantly larger males and a significantly higher density of burrows. The operational sex ratio is also significantly different between the two populations with a female-biased sex ratio in the exploited population. These preliminary results suggest that claw harvesting in fiddler crabs has a measurable effect at the population level. The consequences of this type of fishery in which the individuals are not removed from the population but the population structure is potentially affected need further investigation.

AB  - European fiddler crabs place mudballs around their burrow openings. Both males and females placed mudballs, but there were major differences between the sexes in mudballing behaviour, suggesting that the female's mudballs were a by-product of digging out the burrow whereas the male's may have additional functions. When the male's mudballs were removed experimentally, the number and intensity of male-male agonistic interactions increased significantly; Experimentally visually isolated males spent longer making mudballs and less time waving. In a binary choice test, females were more likely to approach dummy males with mudballs, spent longer near these males and were more likely to enter their burrows than dummy males without mudballs. The same pattern was apparent for males with 30 rather than 20 mudballs. These results are consistent with a dual function for mudballs in U. tangeri: to reduce the number and intensity of aggressive interactions between neighbouring males and to attract females.

AB  - We studied the diet composition and overlap of Scarlet Ibises (Eudocimus ruber) and Little Blue Herons (Egretta caerulea in a mangrove swamp in southeast Brazil during the 1996-1997 breeding season, which occurs during the rainiest period. Crabs comprised 95% of all prey taken by the ibises and 80% of the prey of the herons, Nevertheless, diet overlap was small (similar to 30%) due to ibises feeding mostly on Uca spp. and Eurythium limosum crabs, which were taken from their burrows; the herons fed on the arboreal and semi-arboreal Aratus Pisonii and Metasesarma rubripes crabs. Divergent hunting strategies of ibises (tactile foragers) and herons visually-oriented predators) explains the diet segregation when preying on an ecologically diverse crab guild, but it is unclear why herons prey rarely on fiddler crabs. Scarlet Ibises bred successfully while feeding oil estuarine organisms living in low salinities in the mangroves, showing that mangroves may be adequate foraging habitats for chick-rearing ibises during periods of low salinity.

AB  - Experiments were conducted both at the heated effluents discharge point of a gas flare station in the Niger Delta region and in the laboratory to determine the thermal tolerance of the West African fiddler crab (Uca tangeri). The critical thermal maxima (CTM) was 38oC. Time required for 100% recovery vary from 3 minutes - 50 minutes at temperature ranging 33oC - 37oC after 30 mins exposure. Mortality were observed from 38oC. Elevated temperature could therefore be a lethal factor which determines the distribution of Uca tangeri around heated effluents discharge point of a gas flare station.

AB  - The growth patterns in Uca tangeri, Seserma huzardi and Cardisoma armatum are discussed. The male:female ratios differ from 3:1 in S. huzardi to 2:1 in U. tangari. The males have equal proportions of right and left-handed individuals. Males are generally larger than females and have bigger major chelae. The relationship between carapace and chelae measurements were linear with unimodal and bimodal distributions corresponding to changes in shape of carapace and chelae of different size groups. The chelae of females change a little after maturity but in males, the level of allometry becomes stronger with increase in size. Relative growth rates showed greater correlation coefficients with length rather than weight. The condition factor was influenced by sex in U. tangeri and S. huzardi but by size in C. armatum.

AB  - The allometric method, which often is attributed to Julian Huxley, entails fitting a straight line to logarithmic transformations of the original bivariate data and then back-transforming the resulting equation to form a power function in the arithmetic scale. Development of the technique was strongly influenced by Huxley's own research on growth by the enlarged 'crusher' claw in male fiddler crabs (Uca pugnax). Huxley reported a discontinuity in the log-log plot of chela mass vs body mass, which he interpreted as an abrupt change in relative growth of the chela at about the time crabs attain sexual maturity. My analysis of Huxley's arithmetic data indicates, however, that the discontinuity was an artifact caused by logarithmic transformation and that dynamics of growth by the crusher claw do not change at any point during development. Arithmetic data are well described by a power function fitted by nonlinear regression but not by one estimated by back-transforming a line fitted to logarithms. This finding and others like it call into question the continued reliance on the allometric method in contemporary research.

AB  - Because of its simplicity, the binary-switch nature. of left-right asymmetry permits meaningful comparisons among many different organisms. Phylogenetic analyses of asymmetry variation, inheritance, and molecular. mechanisms reveal unexpected insights into how development evolves. First, directional asymmetry, an evolutionary novelty, arose from nonheritabie origins almost as often as from mutations, implying that genetic assimilation ("phenotype precedes genotype") is a common mode of evolution. Second, the molecular pathway directing hearts leftward-the nodal cascade-varies considerably among vertebrates (homology of form does not require homology of development) and was possibly co-opted from a preexisting asymmetrical chordate organ system. Finally, declining frequencies of spontaneous asymmetry reversal throughout vertebrate evolution suggest that heart development has become more canalized.

AB  - One of the classic organisms used in chronobiological research is the fiddler crab (genus Uca), an animal unique in that it displays both circadian and tidal (i.e., circalunidian) rhythms. The pioneering work on this animal helped produce the early evidence for many of the standard properties now recognized for all circadian rhythms: near temperature independence of the period, phase lability and setability, the light and temperature sensitivity rhythms expressed by phase response curves, and the persistence of rhythms in organs isolated from a multicellular animal. Importantly, results arising from studies of this crab-and a few other organisms-resulted in the development of the exogenous timing hypothesis. While philosophically sound, the lack of supporting evidence for this hypothesis has resulted in it being discarded by most chronobiologists; but while still in its prime, it drew great interest, and therefore grant support, to the field in general, stimulated a great deal of research that otherwise might not have been performed, and resulted in the discovery of environmental stimuli previously unsuspected to influence organisms. As could be expected, continuing work with this crab, using modern approaches and statistical techniques, has modified earlier findings and interpretations, has revealed new properties, and has resulted in the creation of new hypotheses. The review and update is a synthesis of 45 years of this work.

AB  - The living clock that governs tide-associated organismic rhythms has previously been assumed to have a fundamental period of approximately 12.4 h, an interval that reflects the average period of the ebb and flow of the tide. But, in 1986, marine chronobiologists began to accumulate laboratory results that could not be explained by the action of such a clock. Prime among these findings was the discovery that, occasionally, one of the two daily peaks in an organism's rhythm assumed a different period from its partner. Similar results have since been observed in a host of different organisms. These data led to the circalunidian-clock hypothesis that envisions two basic 24.8 h clocks, coupled together in antiphase, as the driving force for these rhythms. There is, however, only a slight difference (50 minutes) in running times between a solar-day clock with a period of approximately 24 h and a lunar-day clock with a period of approximately 24.8 h, both of which display "circa" periods that overlap. Here, I postulate that the two clocks are fundamentally one and the same. (C) 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB  - Temporal patterns of larval occurrence of brachyuran taxa were described from Saco mangrove creek, Mozambique, based on plankton samples. Brachyuran larvae were collected hourly in four 24 h cycles during neap and spring tidal periods at a fixed station, in November 1997 and February 1998. Results indicate a semilunar cycle of larval release activity for most species. Newly-hatched stages of sesarmids showed a peak occurrence in post-crepuscular ebbing tides, Macrophthalmus spp. and Uca spp. showed highest densities during ebbing tides at night. Dotilla fenestrata and Pinnotheridae, in spite of showing a semilunar pattern, did not display significant differences between day and night. Most mangrove taxa showed thus a clear larval exportation behaviour during ebb tides, with little return during the following floods, with varying degrees of dependence on the diel period. Megalopae were restricted to the night period, and highest values were obtained during spring tidal periods. However, maximum values of megalopae were obtained both during flood and ebb periods, contrary to most previous studies. This is interpreted as a bi-directional transport of non-competent megalopae into and from the mangrove area.

AB  - Ultrastructural study of gonia of various species of male carbs [Rhithropanopeus harrisii, Sesarma reticulatum, Uca pugilator, Ocypode quadrata and Callinectes sapidus] shows that these cells are of 2 types: primary and secondary gonia, discriminated according to their location inside or outside the germinative islets, i.e., by the presence or absence of surrounding somatic tissue. The most characteristic feature of the primary spermatogonia is the extrusion of gonial material in the form of lamellar bodies or granules engulfed by the contiguous mesodermal cells; the latter degenerate when they are full of germ cell remnants. Poorly differentiated, the primary gonia have no great variety of cytoplasmic organelles. Two characteristic structures can be recognized in juxtanuclear position: nuage material (electron dense bodies more or less associated with gonia) and chromatoid bodies. Lipid droplets of unknown significance occur sometimes. Secondary spermatogonia divide synchronously although they are placed side by side without any connection such as cytoplasmic bridges. No ultrastructural modification was noticed among the 2 types of gonia in crabs deprived of eyestalks. Mesodermal tissue distributed between primary gonia probably has a double role: inhibition of the onset of gametogenesis (as in Amphipods) and prevention of gonial cytolysis by collection of altered elements. Disappearance of mesodermal cells after destalking experiments reveals that their maintenance is controlled by the eyestalk neurosecretion. An explanation related to the arrest of spermatogenesis in some destalked species is given.

AB  - Fifty-three species of adult crustaceans (excluding Isopoda) are now known from a diversity of non-oceanic habitats on the Galapagos Islands. These include hypersaline, brackish, and fresh coastal and inland surface waters, anchialine subterranean waters, and terrestrial habitats above the high-tide line such as supralittoral beach wrack and upland leaf litter. The faunal assemblage is physiologically defined by evolving away from the ancestral marine environment, before or after reaching the Galapagos Islands. It is taxonomically diverse and includes Notostraca, Conchostraca, Anostraca, Ostracoda (Myodocopa and Podocopa), Copepoda (Calanoida and Cyclopoida), Tanaidacea, Amphipoda, and Decapoda (Caridea, Anomura, and Brachyura). All members of the fauna (or their progenitors) have dispersed across an oceanic gap of at least 1000 km and have colonized the archipelago by three principal methods: (1) as swimming pelagic larvae or adults that dispersed passively by being carried through the sea; (2) through passive transport of nonswimming forms by rafting in or on floating debris on the sea surface; and (3) through passive biological transport of propagules by birds or insects. There is no direct evidence for the aerial (wind) transport of desiccation-resistant dormant stages such as eggs, but it is possible that this has occurred. Twenty-eight species are native and 25 an endemic. The supralittoral species and those in both temporary and permanent surface waters are generally native and widespread in the Americas. Three amphipod genera and one crab genus are endemic. Subterranean (anchialine) waters contain a high percentage of (often eyeless) endemics. The largest evolutionary shift is represented by an upland terrestrial amphipod that has evolved in situ from an ancestral supralittoral species.

AB  - The effect of different organic-rich sewage concentration (0%, 20% and 60% diluted in seawater) and absence or presence of mangrove trees on the survival, bioturbation activities and burrow morphology of fiddler crabs species was assessed. After 6 months, males of both species always showed higher survival (similar to 80%) when compared to females (similar to 20%). Crabs inhabiting pristine conditions achieved higher survival (67-87%) than those living in sewage-exposed mesocosms (40-71%). At 60% sewage loading, fiddler crabs processed less sediment (34-46%) during feeding and excavated slightly more sediment (45-80%) than at pristine conditions. While percent volume of the burrow chambers increased (13-66%) at contaminated mesocosms for both vegetation conditions, burrows were shallower (similar to 33%) in bare cells loaded with sewage. The results show that fiddler crabs presented moderate mortality levels in these artificial mangrove wetlands, but mainly in sewage impacted cells. However, they still function as ecosystem engineers through bioturbation activities and burrow construction. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The effects of anthropogenic activities combined with the lack of technical solutions for sewage treatment have lead to serious contamination problems in the coastal ecosystems of East Africa. However, not all contaminants can be considered pollutants. Determining when contamination results in pollution requires not only chemical but also biological measurements. Because benthos integrates conditions over time, macrobenthic organisms are considered good bioindicators to assess local environmental quality. Crabs constitute one of the most important macrofauna taxa in terms of abundance, species richness and biomass in mangrove ecosystems. In the present study, the reproductive potential and quality of Uca annulipes population inhabiting a peri-urban mangrove, subjected to domestic sewage discharges, was compared to populations inhabiting pristine mangroves. Fecundity, egg quality (fatty acids composition) and potential fertility were evaluated and compared by sampling a representative fraction of ovigerous females captured in each of the mangrove habitats at two, seasons (February to March, 2006 - wet season; and August to September, 2006 - dry season). Most of the measured reproductive parameters of U. annulipes were different at Maputo peri-urban mangrove when compared to nearby pristine locations. Although we cannot prove that sewage discharge done at Costa do Sol mangrove was the main factor influencing the reproductive dynamics of U. annulipes populations, at this peri-urban mangrove this fiddler crab species extended its reproductive season, increased fecundity, as well as improved embryo quality, mainly regarding the concentration of SFA and MUFA, in relation to the pristine mangrove populations.

AB  - We have determined that ShN I, a 48-residue type 2 sea anemone toxin, delays the inactivation of the Na channel in lobster olfactory somas. The effects of this toxin are similar to those observed for the $\alpha$-scorpion toxins and type 1 sea anemone toxins, yet ShN I is structurally distinct from the type 1 toxins. Using a polyclonal antibody prepared against ShN I, no crossreactivity was observed to exist between the type 1 and type 2 anemone toxins. The receptor for ShN I was identified in vesicle preparations of neuronal tissues from both crustaceans and mammals; however, the K$\rm\sb{D}$ value for the former is more than 1,000 fold lower than for the later. The binding of $\lbrack \rm\sp{125}I\rbrack$-ShN I to this receptor was determined to be unaffected by Anemonia sulcata II, depolarization of the membrane, or veratridine. ShN I was unable to displace $\lbrack \rm\sp{125}I\rbrack$-Androctonus austrialis Hector II, whereas unlabeled AaH II and As II displaced the labeled scorpion toxin from rat brain synaptosomes. This is the first characterization of a new Na channel receptor site which specifically binds type 2 anemone toxins. To study the interactions that specific amino acid residues of ShN I have with this receptor, we developed a strategy using solid phase peptide synthesis. Prior to the synthesis of analogs to ShN I, we assembled the native ShN I sequence and reoxidized the three intramolecular disulfide bonds. Chemical, physical, and pharmacological characterization of the purified synthetic ShN I showed it to be indistinguishable from the natural toxin. Monosubstituted analogs of ShN I were synthesized to probe the high density of charged residues localized in the N-terminal region of the molecule. Following oxidation of the disulfide bonds, purification and characterization, these analogs were tested in vivo on fiddler crabs and in vitro on vesicles prepared from crab walking leg nerves. Both of these studies implicated the tri-anionic region of Asp$\sb6$-Asp$\sb7$-Glu$\sb8$ as essential for activity. Substitutions at the positions of Lys$\sb4$ and Asp$\sb{11}$ resulted in analogs with markedly reduced activity and increased K$\sb{0.5}$ values. Substitution of tyrosine for the N-terminal residue had almost no effect on either of these values.

AB  - This study represents the first in a series of validation experiments for the modular estuarine mesocosm testing direct pesticide effects. Endosulfan, an agricultural insecticide, was selected as a model contaminant for studying direct toxic effects as well as uptake of this model contaminant by estuarine biota. The grass shrimp, Palaemonetes pugio, and the mummichog, Fundulus heteroclitus, showed significant mortality (96 h LC50: 0.12 and 2.2 mug/l, respectively) to endosulfan as predicted by laboratory bioassays. There was no effect on fiddler crabs and eastern oysters. The mesocosm was also useful in demonstrating the bioconcentration of endosulfan by eastern oysters (bioconcentration factor [BCF]=375) similar to results reported in field studies. This study illustrates the modular estuarine mesocosms' ability to delect direct effects of pesticide exposure and the uptake of a pesticide by estuarine fauna.

AB  - In euryhaline hyperosmoregulators such as Carcinus maenas, Eriocheir sinensis and Callinectes sapidus, the blood protein content increases in diluted media while blood osmolarity is decreased. In semi-terrestrial hyper-hypoosmoregulators such as Uca minax and Ocypode quadratus, a high blood osmolarity happens concomitantly with a high protein content. These changes in the blood protein concentration upon acclimation from a medium to another one more or less concentrated are discussed in terms of events linked with metabolic phenomena related to the osmoregulatory processes and with mechanisms underlying water economy.

AB  - Between February and June 2010, 113 fiddler crabs Uca spinicarpa were collected from the Chuburna lagoon system on the northern coast of the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico. Of the 68 crabs gathered outside their burrows, 13 were infected with 25 cystacanths of Hexaglandula corynosoma (intensity of infection from 1 to 5) and the remaining 55 crabs were uninfected. The other 45 crabs were found inside their burrows and only one was found infected with 1 cystacanth of H. corynosoma. Serotonin (5-HT) levels were higher in the group of crabs infected with H. corynosoma in contrast to the group of uninfected crabs and the group of those infected with other parasites. A redundancy analysis corroborated a positive relationship between 5-HT and the intensity of infection with H. corynosoma. In contrast, dopamine levels remained similar among different groups of crabs.

AB  - The crystal structure of fiddler crab collagenase complexed with the dimeric serine protease inhibitor ecotin at 2.5 Angstrom resolution reveals an extended cleft providing binding sites for at least 11 contiguous substrate residues. Comparison of the positions of nine intermolecular main chain hydrogen bonding interactions in the cleft, with the known sequences at the cleavage site of type I collagen, suggests that the protease binding loop of ecotin adopts a conformation mimicking that of the cleaved strand of collagen. A well-defined groove extending across the binding surface of the enzyme readily accommodates the two other polypeptide chains of the triple-helical substrate. These observations permit construction of a detailed molecular model for collagen recognition and cleavage by this invertebrate serine protease. Ecotin undergoes a pronounced internal structural rearrangement which permits binding in the observed conformation. The capacity for such rearrangement appears to be a key determinant of its ability to inhibit a wide range of serine proteases.

AB  - Mangrove ecosystems strongly influence the sedimentology and geomorphology of contemporary intertidal environments and are known to have occupied similar ecological niches at least as far back as the early Cenozoic. Given this it is remarkable how few records of mangrove occurrence have been reported in the geologic record. Here a microfacies approach is adopted to examine the characteristics of a contemporary mangrove-colonized intertidal succession along an active prograding shoreline in north Queensland, Australia, and compared with a proximal mid-late Holocene preserved intertidal succession. This enables a comparison of microfacies development and preservation potential in like-for-like depositional environments over short temporal and spatial scales. In the contemporary intertidal system, active shoreline progradation has produced a highly gradational shallowing-upward succession. Mid- to low-intertidal substrates, characterized by an abundant and diverse bioclast (especially molluscan) fauna and a rich calcareous foraminiferal assemblage, are overlain by organic-rich (upper-intertidal) mangrove facies, characterized by abundant organic material (especially wood and bark fragments) and a distinct fauna of agglutinated foraminifera. The major sedimentary effects of mangrove progradation are to introduce substantial amounts of organic matter into the substrate (effectively overprinting the mudflat facies), to mix and re-texture (due to root network development and infaunal bioturbation) the sediment substrate, and to modify the depth ranges over which infaunal molluscs and foraminifera occur. Variations in the relative abundance of constituents permit, however, the clear delineation of mangrove and intertidal mudflat facies. Whilst an essentially similar facies succession is identifiable in the sub-Recent, many of the diagnostic facies constituents are either not preserved or are present in far lower abundances than in the modern. In particular, the inferred mangrove units contain far less organic material (most wood and root material is absent), are essentially devoid of bioclastic material and contain a depauperate agglutinated foraminiferal fauna. The primary drivers of this are (1) loss of calcareous foraminifera and bioclasts due to carbonate dissolution, (2) loss of agglutinated foraminifera due primarily to biological (fiddler crab) test degradation and mineralization of their organic binding agents, and (3) aerobic and anaerobic degradation of organic material. Consequently, actual criteria for identifying the presence of a former mangrove in this succession are limited. Such poor preservation, even within sub-Recent mangrove deposits, suggest that the longer-term preservation potential of key diagnostic criteria is likely to be extremely poor within similar terrigenoclastic-dominated, organically enriched successions. Thus, whilst mangroves significantly modify and re-texture intertidal substrates, use may often need to be made of sparsely preserved faunal or floral remains or traces, interpreted in the context of the broader intertidal depositional succession, to infer the presence of mangrove-colonized substrates in the rock record.

AB  - Females commonly exhibit mating preferences when they are allowed to choose between two alternative courtship signals. However, they also commonly approach any courtship signal when presented on its own (no-choice experiments). This could have consequences for male and female fitness. Males with nonpreferred stimuli may successfully attract females if they are, fortuitously, far enough away from competing males to prevent direct comparison. In the banana fiddler crab, Uca mjoebergi, we show, using a combination of no-choice and two-choice experiments, that there was interplay between detectability and preference. We found that preferred stimuli were not more detectable at a distance. Females were more likely to exhibit a preference when they could directly compare two stimuli that were close together and viewed in the same field of vision. Once the decision to approach one male over another had been made, it was not changed, even when more information became available. (C) 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB  - In this paper, we present results of a 4 year investigation of the dynamics of patches of fiddler crab larvae (Uca spp.) in southern Delaware Bay and the nearby coastal ocean. The study addressed 4 research questions: (1) What are the processes that result in the genesis and transport of patches; (2) How large are patches; (3) What is the density of larvae within a typical patch; and (4) How long do patches remain integral? The investigation included characterization of the 2-dimensional distribution of larvae as determined by high-frequency plankton sampling and determination of trajectories of patches using satellite technology. We also conducted numerical model simulations of the early stages of patch formation and compared model outcomes to real world observations. Results of earlier investigations have shown that fiddler crab larvae are released near the time of high tide during nocturnal spring tidal periods. Our results indicate that newly hatched fiddler crab larvae are exported from small tidal rivers in a single, long continuous patch. These patches probably result from synchronized spawning of a large number of females. Along-stream dimensions of the patches at our sampling site were at least 8 to 9 km, and maximum densities of larvae were as high as 3 x 10(4) m(-3). Only part of each patch exited the river during the first ebb tide following hatching. Numerical simulations showed that the remaining portion exited the river during subsequent ebb tides following hatching. Patches observed in Delaware Bay were no longer constrained by the river banks and consequently spread out in response to dissipative physical processes; maximum densities were similar to 10(3) m(-3). Numerical simulations demonstrated a similar change in shape of patches as they entered the bay. Trajectories of bay patches were strongly influenced by tidal circulation, which resulted in transport of larvae back and forth along the shore of the bay at tidal frequency. Patches of Uca larvae were also observed on the inner shelf near the mouth of the bay. Shelf patches consisted mainly of advanced-stage zoea larvae, with maximum densities up to several hundred m(-3). Megalopae were also observed in patch-like aggregations, both in open bay water and in the river; densities were on the order of 10(2) m(-3).

AB  - 1. Crude extracts of Limulus CNS cause hyperglycemia in Orconectes immunis and expand chromatophores in Uca pugilator. 2. The hyperglycemic action is due to a previously unknown polypeptide (LHGF) with an estimated molecular weight of 6400 daltons. LHGF is inactivated by hydrogen peroxide, pepsin, and protease, but unaffected by trypsin and brief boiling.3. The chromatophorotropic activity is due to the previously reported substance, LUC. LUC is shown to be a peptide with an approximate molecular weight of 1850 daltons; it is inactivated by hydrogen peroxide, protease, pepsin, trypsin, chymotrypsin, and thermolysin. 4. LUC and LHGF activity can be readily separated by gel filtration on a Sephadex G-25 column. 5. The similarity of LUC and LHGF to known crustacean hormones is dicussed.

AB  - There are few studies on brachyuran crabs associated to the mangrove swamps of the Mexican coasts. In this study, distribution aspects and reproductive biology of selected species were examined between 1997 and 2002. Samples wereobtained in the areas of the north coast of Santa Rosalia, Mulege, Concepcion bay, Loreto bay, San Jose Island and the insular complex of Espiritu Santo. Eight families with 24 species were recognized. The family Grapsidae, with six species, was the more abundant group in the major part of the localities, followed by the families Ocypodidae (six species) and Panopeidae(three species). The most common species were Goniopsis pulchra, Sesarma sulcatum, Cardisoma crassum, Callinectes arcuatus and Uca crenulata coloradensis; the latter is commonly found when citations in the literature are considered. Cardisoma crassum was a very conspicuous species commonly observed along the borders of mangroves swamps with muddy substrate. In a quantitative and continuous study of the crabs found in the oyster trays in the swamp of El Conchalito, the most abundant species were Acantholobulus mirafloresensis and Goetice americanus (67% and 31% of relative proportion, respectively of each species). The reproductive period and the overall sex ratios were observed. For A. mirafloresensis, ovigerous females were found in major number from September to October, and the sex ratio (F:M) was of 1: 2 and of 1: 3 in one sample. There were no ovigerous females of G. americanus and the sex ratio F:M was variable in each sampling, from 2: 1, 1: 1 to 1: 4.

AB  - This investigation was undertaken to determine whether the mosquito larvicide temephos (applied as Abate 4-E(R)) created an environmental hazard for nontarget organisms in a southwest Florida salt marsh community. Field toxicity tests were performed during routine larvicide applications using larvae of salt marsh crabs (Aratus pesonii and Uca rapax) and adult Mysidopsis bahia. Laboratory toxicity tests were performed using survival through 48 and 96 h and through first molt as toxicity endpoints. Larvae of both species exhibited 96 h lowest observable effects concentration (LOEC) in the range of 15 to 20 mu g/L temephos. First-molt LOEC ranged from 7 to 12 mu g/L. No effect on M. bahia survival, growth, or fecundity was observed up to 40 mu g/L temephos. Field studies of routine temephos application rates produced an expected environmental concentration (EEC) of 12 +/- 10 mu g/L in marsh water, causing an environmental hazard to crab larvae. Reduction of the application rate effectively reduced the EEC to 4 +/- 3 mu g/L, indicating no hazard for 48 and 96 h toxicity; however, a hazard was observed for survival through the first molt. This information was used to modify larviciding applications to effect a reduction of the environmental hazard to nontarget organisms in the salt marsh.

AB  - The nontarget effects of temephos (as Abate(R) 4E, 44.6% active ingredient) on fiddler crabs were examined on the salt marsh at Bombay Hook National Wildlife Refuge, near Dover, DE. Six 170 x 170-m plots were established; 3 were sprayed on 4 occasions at a rate of 1.5 fl oz/acre (0.054 kg active ingredient/ha) and 3 were controls. On each plot, marsh fiddler crab (Uca pugnax) populations were monitored by repeatedly counting the number of burrow holes in 2 counting areas marked out along tidal guts. One half of each counting area was covered with bird netting to evaluate sublethal toxic effects, which, if present, could result in increased susceptibility to bird predation. A statistically significant linear association was established between the number of holes and the number of crabs. No significant differences were found in the numbers of holes (or crabs) in the sprayed vs, control plots and in the covered vs. uncovered sections. However, survival of juvenile crabs in in situ bioassays was significantly reduced (16% lower) by the spraying. Median acetylcholinesterase activity in claw muscle of red-jointed fiddler crabs (Uca minax) collected 2 days after an operational spray with Abate 4E was significantly reduced (28% lower) compared to unsprayed crabs. In view of the toxicity to juvenile crabs and the cholinesterase inhibition, we recommend continued monitoring and research for nontarget impacts of Abate 4E on fiddler crabs to establish whether the reported level of cholinesterase inhibition results in acute or chronic toxicity.

AB  - Brachyuran larvae were sampled every two hours at two depths in Indian River Inlet over six consecutive tidal cycles. Larvae from seven taxa were collected. Three taxa were identified at the level of species. Pinnixa spp. and Uca spp. zoeae were most common at the surface on ebbing tides and were apparently exported to coastal shelf waters. Uca spp. and Callinectes sapidus megalopae were common near the bottom on flooding tides. This would promote retention in the estuary and is consistent with previous reports in the literature. Ovalipes ocellatus, Cancer irroratus and Libinia spp. were most common on flooding tides. This suggests that a pool of these larvae existed in adjacent coastal waters, and that these larvae were carried into the inlet on flooding tides.

AB  - Many territorial advertisement signals are thought to be dual- function signals, directed to both rival male and receptive female conspecifics. However, few studies have tested this assumption by examining whether in fact both sexes are likely to elicit signaling behavior from territorial males. In this study, I experimentally manipulated the social context of male sand fiddler crabs (Uca pugilator) to investigate the effect of different audiences on the performance of the claw-waving display, a territorial signal that is often presumed to be directed to both males and females. To test whether males perform this signal to both audiences, I measured the frequency of waving behavior by focal males when housed in field enclosures alone, with only males, with only females, or with both males and females. Focal males waved at a low frequency when alone, and the presence of males had no effect on their level of waving. However, in the presence of females, focal males showed a significantly higher level of waving, whether or not males were also present. In addition, there was no association between fighting and waving behavior. This experiment provides evidence that from the perspective of the signaling male, the claw-waving display of U. pugilator is not a dual-function signal but rather is primarily directed to receptive females.

AB  - Like many territory advertisement signals, the claw waving display of fiddler crabs (genus Uca)) is commonly thought to have the dual function of simultaneously repelling males and attracting females. I have found, however, that male sand fiddler crabs (U. pugilator) wave significantly more in the presence of females than males, suggesting that their waves are primarily directed to females. Here I use laboratory video playback experiments to ask whether male and female LI. pugilator are both responsive to the display. Males and females were presented with video of an example of either a waving or a feeding male conspecific, or no video, and their behavior was measured in seven behavioral categories that were then collapsed into three principal components. Analysis of variance of females' principal component scores revealed significant differences in their behavior in the presence of waving male video compared with feeding male video or no video, demonstrating that females attend to the display. Male behavior, however, was not significantly different between the three treatments, which is inconsistent with the hypothesis that claw waving serves to repel or threaten other males. These results, together with my recent work on male signaling behavior, suggests that the claw waving display of U. pugilator is a signal primarily directed to females and attended to by females, and thus is not an example of a dual function signal.

AB  - Competition between species can include signal competition in addition to competition for space and resources. Fiddler crabs (Uca spp.) are an excellent system for examining visual signal competition given their use of visual displays and burrow structures such as sand hoods. Where fiddler crab species overlap in habitat, females may face challenges as signal receivers to avoid heterospecifics and simultaneously discriminate among conspecific males. We investigated the consequences of competition between two species, U. latimanus and U. musica, which both build hoods and intermingle in the same habitat. Males of U. latimanus were larger than U. musica and had claws that were relatively shorter but potentially more powerful, suggesting that U. latimanus may be a superior competitor in direct combat. The hoods of the two species differed significantly in average size and shape, and in areas where they had heterospecific neighbours, U. musica males built hoods that were more distinct from heterospecific hoods, whereas U. latimanus built hoods that were more similar to heterospecific hoods. Wandering male U. musica were less likely to approach heterospecific than conspecific males, whereas U. latimanus were not. Wandering females of both species approached significantly more conspecific than heterospecific males, although some U. musica females entered heterospecific burrows. Uca latimanus females were significantly more attracted to conspecifics with hoods than without hoods; and although U. musica females showed the same tendency, the trend was only marginally significant. The high density of heterospecific males may reduce the ability of female U. musica to discriminate among conspecific males. (C) 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB  - This paper reviews behavioral, physiological, anatomical, and ecological aspects of sound and vibration detection by decapod crustaceans. Our intent is to demonstrate that despite very limited work in this area in the past 20 years, evidence suggests that at least some decapod crustaceans are able to detect and use sounds in ways that parallel detection and processing mechanisms in aquatic and terrestrial vertebrates. Some aquatic decapod crustaceans produce sounds, and many are able to detect substrate vibration at sensitivities sufficient to tell of the proximity of mates, competitors, or predators. Some semi-terrestrial crabs produce and use sounds for communication. These species detect acoustic stimuli as either air- or substrate-borne energies, socially interact in acoustic "choruses," and probably use "calls" to attract mates.

AB  - The relative growth of the fiddler crab Uca cumulanta was studied, primarily to determine the size at the onset of sexual maturity for a mangrove population in the estuary of the Patitiba River, Paraty, Rio de Janeiro state, Brazil. The evaluation of the morphological sexual maturity of U. cumulanta was performed using the allometric technique. The relationships that most precisely indicated the size at onset of sexual maturity were carapace length (CL) vs propodus length for males and CL vs abdomen width for females. Males and females are mature at 5.25 and 4.75 mm CL, respectively. The remarkable ontogenetic changes observed in the allometric growth of the male major cheliped and the female abdomen, indicate that growth of these structures is closely connected to the timing of sexual maturity. The relative size at onset maturity obtained for this species was 0.68 and this index was compared to that seen in other species in the genus.

AB  - 1. In male Sand Fiddler Crabs, Uca pugilator, a major cheliped (with claw), used in intersexual displays and intrasexual contests, develops opposite a minor cheliped used for feeding. Cheliped size demonstrates antisymmetry because greater development is equally likely on the right or left side. 2. The side with the major cheliped (major side) also has longer walking legs which may facilitate use of the claw. In contrast, eye stalk asymmetry is equally due to antisymmetry and fluctuating asymmetry. Fluctuating asymmetry is a subtle, non- adaptive departure from the population-level trajectory relating growth on major and minor sides. 3. In a South Carolina (USA) marsh, cheliped and leg antisymmetries are greater and eye stalk asymmetry is less among males able to defer feeding in favour of breeding. However, the composition of up-slope breeding and down-slope feeding subpopulations changes across the lunar cycle. 4. The number of mates sequestered in breeding burrows is positively correlated with cheliped and leg antisymmetry and negatively correlated with eye stalk asymmetry. Male fitness is a function of the product of time spent breeding and the number of mates per unit time while breeding. Both fitness components are predicted by relative cheliped antisymmetry and eye stalk fluctuating asymmetry, which are themselves significantly negatively correlated.

AB  - Male sand fiddler crabs (Uca pugilator) defend territories that consist of a breeding burrow and a display area where they wave their claw to attract females. Burrow-holding males engage in agonistic contests with both intruding males that attempt burrow take-overs and with other territory-holding neighbors that apparently attempt to limit waving or other surface activities of rivals. Contests employ one or more behavioral elements that range from no claw contact to use of the claw to push, grip, or flip an opponent. We placed each observed element into one of six groups ranked by intensity, which was based on the degree of claw contact and apparent energy expenditure. In the field, contests with intruders began at higher intensity and escalated more rapidly than did those with neighbors. Thus. U. pugilator males exhibit a dear enemy response toward neighbors. However, resident-resident contests increased in intensity when burrows were close, neighbors faced each other when exiting burrows, and neighbors were of similar size. Proximity and orientation determine the ease with which a neighbor may be engaged. Also, neighbors that are close and of similar size pose a greater threat to mating opportunities, favoring heightened intensity of contests.

We examined within- and between-individual variation in the boldness of courting male sand fiddler crabs, Uca pugilator, across an entire breeding season at a South Carolina (USA) salt marsh where courtship is restricted to supratidal embankments. Boldness was assessed by the time to re-emergence and the number of re-emergences of males who were purposely startled into their breeding burrows once every 3 min for a total of five times. The two measures of boldness were significantly positively correlated. Courting males are on average bolder when their density is high and when tidal conditions correspond to peaks in the number of females moving over the embankment surface. Time to re-emergence increases with successive startles although some males consistently re-emerge faster than others. Large males are not bolder than small males. When male density is high, nearest neighbors frequently re-emerge at the same time, suggesting that males cue on the responses of other nearby males, perhaps by assessing substrate vibration. This may reduce the chance of losing a potential mate to a local competitor.

AB  - In South Carolina, two species of fiddler crab, Uca pugilator and U. pugnax, often feed in droves on the sand flats of smooth cordgrass salt marshes. Another fiddler crab, U. minax, does not drove, but large males of this species occasionally move onto sand flats and prey on members of the other smaller species. Successful predatory attacks entail a pounce, entrapment of prey in ambulatory appendages, reorientation of the predator to the supine position, maneuvering of the prey between the daetyl and propodus of the major cheliped, killing the prey by piercing or crushing its carapace with the major cheliped, and consumption. Females are successfully attacked with higher frequency than males. The frequency of predatory attacks declines exponentially as the composition of droves becomes biased towards larger males. This may indicate that predators face injury when attacking large males because only males possess potentially defensive claws and claw length increases with the square of body width. Uca pugilator individuals form pods in response to the approach of a predator. Pods are tight clumps of fleeing individuals that may function as mini-selfish herds. Pod composition is biased towards individuals most susceptible to U. minax predation, females and males of small body size, suggesting that pod formation is a selectively advantageous behavior.

AB  - The single enlarged claw of male sand fiddler crabs, Uca pugilator, is used in contests for control of breeding burrows. The larger of the two contestants has the larger claw and usually wins. Males use one or more of 10 agonistic elements that vary in intensity from a no-contact extension of the claw to the flip of an opponent. We used the sequence of elements employed and the duration of unstaged, naturally occurring contests in a South Carolina salt marsh to evaluate three models of extended contests: (1) energetic war of attrition, (2) cumulative assessment and (3) sequential assessment. Contests usually began with elements of low action intensity and often proceeded to elements of high intensity. Elements of higher intensity were correlated with both contest duration and the number of contest elements. Contest duration increased as opponents became more evenly matched in size, a result consistent with both cumulative and sequential assessment models. Variation in duration increased as the relative sizes of opponents increased, also in accordance with sequential assessment. The absolute size of the smaller contestant had no effect on contest duration, in contrast to predictions based on cumulative assessment or energetic war of attrition models. Contestants that lost a fight were more likely to engage immediately in another fight without loss of contest intensity, if their previous fight had been long and intense. This result is inconsistent with contests of endurance, such as the energetic war of attrition or the cumulative assessment game, but it is consistent with the ritualized display of strength and fighting skill. Thus, sequential assessment appears to best explain ritualized fiddler crab contests. Cumulative assessment, however, may be the appropriate model for extended, nonritualized, all-out fights. Cumulative assessment may also explain the tenure of individuals on breeding grounds where multiple engagements are likely to test endurance and tolerance to damage over a period of days.

AB  - Population density and morphometric aspects of the crab Uca rapax rapax from the Bocaripo Lagoon in Sucre, Venezuela, were evaluated using different methods. Stratified random sampling was used in a 843 m2 area. Estimates on test samples of 0.04 m2 indicated an average population density of 17.75 ind/m2, while the population density in strata of greater abundance (II and III), based on visual counts of crabs and their burrows on quadrates of 0.25 m2, indicated that figures corresponding to the burrows were always higher than the visual counts, noting significant differences (p<0.05) between them in the strata of greatest abundance (III), but not in the strata of medium population density (II). Both methods produced similar results. Morphometric relationships between the width (AC) and length (LC) of the shell and the body weight were positive and highly significant for both sexes (r2 = 0.80 for males and r2 = 0.70 for females; p< 0.01). The relationship between shell width and length was also significant (r2 = 0.84; p< 0.01).

AB  - Homodimerization of the retinoid X receptor (RXR) occurs upon binding of ligands to the receptor, but little is known about structural mechanisms involved in RXR ligand binding. In the present study, binding of known ligands (5-Hydroxytryptamine, dopamine and naloxone) to the Celuca pugilator RXR was modeled computationally using the human RXR-alpha as a homology template. Docking scores calculated for these ligands showed reasonably good binding interactions to C. pugilator RXR. Furthermore. RXR is the receptor that mediates the different activities of neurotransmitters and opioid against naloxone in crustaceans and possibly other species. These results indicate that 5-hydroxytryptamine and naloxone might have similar functions. These also results suggest a 3-D model of C pugilator RXR that describes the binding of ligands at a single RXR receptor binding site and offers further insight into the binding of structurally diverse ligands to this receptor. Further, computational studies showed that crustacean RXRs might be closer to vertebrate RXR than to insect RXR. The predicted binding models for C pugilator RXR may allow for better design of experimental studies, such as site-directed mutagenesis and affinity labeling studies that may yield valuable information concerning structure-activity relationship studies of RXR and its ligands.

AB  - Long term patterns of crustacean behavior are profoundly influenced by cycles of molting and reproduction. The crustacean eyestalk has neurosecretory organs that affect molting and gonadal development via inhibition. I examined how photoperiod and temperature interact to control these processes via the eyestalk endocrine system in the spiny lobster, Panulirus argus. Short photoperiod (8:16) and warm temperature (28(DEGREES)C) shortened the molt cylce when compared to long photoperiod (16:8) controls. This acceleration was due to the shortening of the transition from intermolt (stage C) to proecdysis (stage D(,o)). Short photoperiod also shortened the molt cycle compared to long photoperiod at 21(DEGREES)C. Photoperiod has an intergral role in the seasonal regulation of the lobster molt cycle. Gonadal recrudescence does not occur in the summer and winter when lobsters are treated with either long (16:8) or short (8:16) days at either 21(DEGREES) or 28(DEGREES)C. In the spring, short days induce gonadal growth, but long days inhibit gonadal growth. Apparently, gonad recrudescence is refractory to photic or thermal stimulation in the summer and winter, but not in the spring. Studies of several crustaceans have demonstrated that eyestalk factors affect molt and gonadal development (Kleinholz, 1976). Eyestalk ablated lobsters develop gonads larger than intact controls. Similarly, eyestalk ablated lobsters molt faster than intact controls. However, eyestalk ablated lobsters that molt have significantly smaller gonads than those eyestalk ablated lobsters that do not molt. Sinus glands implanted into eyestalk ablated lobsters slow both gonadal development and the molt cycle duration, when compared to eyestalk ablated controls. Extracts of the eyestalk injected into either eyestalk ablated P. argus or the crab, Uca pugilator inhibit the anticipated gonadal growth. An extract of the eyestalks of P. argus was chromatographed on Sephadex G-25, then bioassayed for melanophore dispersion, molt inhibition, and gonadal inhibition in the crab, Uca pugilator. The peak of gonad inhibiting activity had an rf value equal to .45 (+OR-) .02, the peak of molt inhibiting activity had an rf value of .39 (+OR-) .02. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the Sephadex column fractions found that gonad-inhibiting-hormone, GIH, had a molecular weight near 5000 Daltons, molt-inhibiting-hormone, MIH has a molecular weight less than 3485 Daltons. GIH from lobsters can disperse the Uca melanophores, but the lobster MIH does not. The pigment-dispersing-hormone, PDH, from Uca eyestalks has the same molecular weight as the lobster GIH. PDH can also inhibit gonadal growth in the fiddler crabs. It is concluded that lobster GIH and the chromatophorotropins are related peptides, but they both are distinct from MIH.

AB  - Eystalk-ablated spiny lobster, P. argus develop gonads larger than their intact controls. Eyestalk-ablated lobsters molt faster than intact controls and both groups survive ecdysis without mortality. Those eyestalk-ablated lobsters exhibiting an accelerated molting cycle show correspondingly small gonadal development with those showing great gonadal growth do not exhibit accelerated molting. The phase relationship of the 2 processes appears to be regulated in an antagonistic manner. Boiled eyestalk extract injected into either eyestalk-ablated P. argus or Uca pugilator stored gonadal inhibition. The sinus gland apparently possesses a heat-stable factor inhibiting gonadal growth.

AB  - Burrowing by crabs is an important component of their functional role in mangrove biotopes. The Fiddler crab (Uca) is one of the more conspicuous burrowing organisms in the mangrove areas of Pakistan. To evaluate interspecific differences in burrowing behaviour between three species of Uca (U. annulipes, U. chlorophthalmus and U. sindensis), we compared vegetation cover, sediment composition and burrow morphology by using plaster of Paris casts. Five burrow morphology characters were measured (burrow number, depth, length, volume, and diameter of the burrow openings). Nearly all the morphological characters of the burrows differed significantly between species. The burrow morphology variations were correlated with the tidal level (distance from the water mark during low tide), porosity, percent organic matter, vegetation cover and structure of the sediments. The species-specific differences in the burrows cautions against generalizing regarding the functional role of fiddler crabs along the coast of Pakistan.

AB  - Habituation is an active process that allows animals to learn to identify repeated, harmless events, and so could help individuals deal with the trade-off between reducing the risk of predation and minimizing escape costs. Safe habituation requires an accurate distinction between dangerous and harmless events, but in natural environments such an assessment is challenging because sensory information is often noisy and limited. What, then, comprises the information animals use to recognize objects that they have previously learned to be harmless? We tested whether the fiddler crab Uca vomeris distinguishes objects purely by their sensory signature or whether identification also involves more complex attributes such as the direction from which an object approaches. We found that crabs habituated their escape responses after repeated presentations of a dummy predator consistently approaching from the same compass direction. Females habituated both movement towards the burrow and descent into the burrow, whereas males only habituated descent into the burrow. The crabs were more likely to respond again when a physically identical dummy approached them from a new compass direction. The crabs distinguished between the two dummies even though both dummies were visible for the entire duration of the experiment and there was no difference in the timing of the dummies' movements. Thus, the position or approach direction of a dummy encodes important information that allows animals to identify an event and habituate to it. These results argue against the traditional notion that habituation is a simple, non-associative learning process, and instead suggest that habituation is very selective and uses information to distinguish between objects that is not available from the sensory signature of the object itself.

AB  - Uca pugilator are semi-terrestrial brachyuran fiddler crabs that inhabit inter-tidal sand and mud flats. They are social animals that rely exclusively on visual information during several of their behaviors that include mate choice, predator avoidance, burrow surveillance, courtship and territorial interactions. Through several behavioral and optical experiments, it has been previously shown that they have 360° viewing angle on each eye, high spatial resolution along their eye's midline, improved resolution on the vertical axes and posses excellent optomotor stabilization mechanism. Such understanding of their retinal design has helped us realize that the eyes of fiddler crabs are adapted for specific visual tasks in their geometrically structured habitat. However, the physiological capabilities of this retina are not yet completely understood, especially at the photoreceptor level. The objective of my thesis has been to fill this gap in knowledge, and specifically determine the spatial, temporal and spectral properties of photoreceptor cells through an integrative approach, using several molecular and electrophysiological techniques. Through these experiments, I have shown that the spatial resolution of the eye is best along the eye's midline (∼1°), photoreceptor cells are capable of perceiving up to ∼45Hz of flickering light stimuli and that they are capable of perceiving color cues including in the ultra-violet.

AB  - Fiddler crabs are intertidal brachyuran crabs that belong to the genus Uca. Approximately 97 different species have been identified, and several of these live sympatrically. Many have species-specific body color patterns that may act as signals for intra-and interspecific communication. To understand the behavioral and ecological role of this coloration we must know whether fiddler crabs have the physiological capacity to perceive color cues. Using a molecular approach, we identified the opsin-encoding genes and determined their expression patterns across the eye of the sand fiddler crab, Uca pugilator. We identified three different opsin-encoding genes (UpRh1, UpRh2 and UpRh3). UpRh1 and UpRh2 are highly related and have similarities in their amino acid sequences to other arthropod long-and medium-wavelength-sensitive opsins, whereas UpRh3 is similar to other arthropod UV-sensitive opsins. All three opsins are expressed in each ommatidium, in an opsin-specific pattern. UpRh3 is present only in the R8 photoreceptor cell, whereas UpRh1 and UpRh2 are present in the R1-7 cells, with UpRh1 expression restricted to five cells and UpRh2 expression present in three cells. Thus, one photoreceptor in every ommatidium expresses both UpRh1 and UpRh2, providing another example of sensory receptor coexpression. These results show that U. pugilator has the basic molecular machinery for color perception, perhaps even trichromatic vision.

AB  - This report summarizes recent work on the pigment-dispersing hormone (PDH) family, a set of related neuropeptides common to arthropods. The primary structures are known for the major form of PDH in several crustacean species (Pandalus borealis, Uca pugilator, Cancer magister, Penaeus aztecus, Procambarus clarkii) and for related pigment-dispersing factors from two insects (Acheta domesticus, Romalea microptera). In this peptide family, the amino acid chain length (18 residues), termini (N-terminal Asn, C-terminal Ala-NH2), and at least 50% of the sequence are conserved. Synthetic analogs have been used to analyze the structure-activity relations of PDH, leading to: an evaluation of the role of specific residues; a tentative identification of the message sequence; and the preparation of stable and superpotent analogs including tyrosinated analogs for radioiodination. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) has been developed for .beta.-PDH. Antisera raised against .alpha.-PDH and .beta.-PDH were used to determine the distribution of PDH. This distribution and other evidence indicate that, besides its role in humoral regulation of the pigmentary system, PDH may serve extra-pigmentary functions. The functions of the PDH-related peptides in insects are unknown.

AB  - In most species the operational sex ratio is male biased, so females can be choosy when selecting a mate. Male choosiness, however, may also be beneficial, especially in species where female quality is variable, male mating investment is high and there is a high probability of attracting additional females. We investigated male choosiness in the fiddler crab Uca mjoebergi. Clutch size was positively correlated with female size. Since male mating investment is high ( prolonged mate guarding), males would therefore benefit by mating with large females. Males were capable of discriminating between large and small females, and under both natural and experimental conditions they preferentially courted larger females. They did not, however, forego mating opportunities with small females, probably because the operational sex ratio was highly male biased, which limited their opportunity for attracting a second mate. Thus male U. mjoebergi not only engaged in competition for matings, but also showed mate choice.

AB  - While mate choice is often assumed to be based on an absolute value that may reflect underlying male quality, many mating systems facilitate the comparative evaluation of males. Females can encounter a number of potential mates, either sequentially or simultaneously, before making a mate choice decision. Consequently, the attractiveness of one male may depend on the attractiveness of other males a female has previously encountered. To examine whether female choice in the fiddler crab Uca mjoebergi is based on the comparative evaluation of males, I altered the social context in which a set of males were encountered. Using a robotic crab system to manipulate claw size and wave rate directly, I determined female preference for two male options in the absence and presence of an asymmetrically dominating decoy option. The decoy male option was designed to change the relative attractiveness of the initial two male options. The presence of the decoy significantly altered the absolute preference, but not the relative preference, for the two male options. While this study clearly demonstrates that female U. mjoebergi are not using strict absolute preferences when ranking each male's attractiveness, it does not conclusively support comparative evaluation mechanisms. One possibility is that sexually selected traits in a complex signalling system often vary in how reliably they reflect male quality, and females may use a combination of absolute and comparative measures when assessing male quality.

AB  - We studied sampling behaviour and mate choice in the fiddler crab Uca mjoebergi. Once a female selects a mate, she copulates in his burrow and remains there until releasing her aquatic larvae. U. mjoebergi occurs in habitats that are inundated only by the highest amplitude spring tides. Females can only release their larvae during these tides, and release before or after will result in complete failure of reproductive effort. Matings occur over a 5-day period near the end of neap tides. Our results suggest that within the mating period, females adjust their larval developmental rates by selecting specific burrows in which to incubate their clutches. We found that at the start of the mating period, females chose larger males as mates. Since male size was positively correlated to burrow width, females were selecting wide burrows and effectively incubating at lower temperatures. This would slow down the developmental rates of larvae. In contrast, females that mated late in the mating period selectively chose small males. By incubating in narrower, warmer burrows, these females may increase the developmental rates of larvae. We propose that females are selecting burrows to influence incubation rate and ensure timely release of their larvae. Female U. mjoebergi appear to adjust their preference for the direct benefits of mate choice to increase their reproductive success.

AB  - Evidence is growing that an individual's propensity to take risks in the presence of a predator is correlated to behaviors that can affect individual fitness. We examined whether risk-taking behavior predicts aggression, surface activity levels, and mating success in male fiddler crabs, Uca mjoebergi. Risk-taking behavior was highly consistent among individuals, remained stable over time, and was unrelated to male size. We found that males that took greater risks in the presence of a potential predator also behaved more aggressively when searching for a new territory. In addition, bold males exhibited higher surface activity levels and spent more time courting females compared with their shy counterparts. Although risk-taking behavior was independent of other sexually selected traits, it accurately predicted male mating success in U. mjoebergi. We suggest nonsexually selected traits, such as risk taking, may represent important behavioral predictors of success in other species.

AB  - The fiddler crab Uca mjoebergi mates both underground in male-defended burrows and on the surface near female-defended burrows. The reproductive tract of Uca species facilitates last-male precedence, suggesting that males that do not guard-mated females are likely to gain very little paternity if the female re-mates with another male. Here, we test the reproductive success of burrow and surface matings using paternity analysis. We found that 100 % of the females that mated in burrows extruded a clutch of eggs. Furthermore, we show conclusively, for the first time in a fiddler crab species, that last-male sperm precedence results in the majority of the female's eggs being fertilised by the burrow-mated male. In contrast, surface matings resulted in significantly fewer females extruding eggs (5.6 %). Paternity analysis also revealed that more than half of the clutches from burrow-mated females showed low levels of extra-pair paternity from previous matings. Although multiple matings appear common in U. mjoebergi, burrow-mated males that guard females are guaranteed a successful mating with extremely high rates of assured paternity. Surface matings therefore appear to be an opportunistic tactic that may increase male reproductive success in a highly competitive environment.

AB  - Underlying male quality is often reflected in the condition of sexually selected traits. In fiddler crabs, male success in both intra- and interspecific interactions is highly dependent on the size of the major claw. However, males are often forced to autotomize their major claw. Claw regeneration significantly altered the structure of a males' major claw in Uca mjoebergi. We found, however, that claw regeneration did not affect signal quality. Both males and females were unable to visually distinguish a regenerated claw from an original claw. Although regenerated males were inferior fighters, males were able to compensate for this fighting disadvantage by avoiding fights with other males. Regenerated males were, however, less likely to acquire and defend high-quality territories and consequently suffered a decrease in mating success.

AB  - Diflubenzuron (Dimilin) is used as an insecticide for control of the gypsy moth. Because it is a chitin synthetase inhibitor, it can be a potential threat to other arthropods, including crustaceans. We used a static renewal testing paradigm to determine the LC(50) of Dimilin WP-25 to juvenile blue crabs (carapace width: 25-60 mm). Both molt stage and dose frequency affected toxicity. When we exposed the crabs at random molt stages, LC(50) = 3.5 mg l(-1). When crabs were exposed on the day of molt, LC(50) = 300 mu g l(-1). If initial exposure occurred on the day of molt and the crabs were subsequently exposed to repeated doses, LC(50) = 18.5 mu g l(-1). Effects were age and molt-stage sensitive. We include a review of the data available on Dimilin effects in the marine and estuarine environments.

AB  - The effects of cadmium exposure on the color change system of the fiddler crab, Uca pugilator, were determined. Crabs were either immersed in 10 ppm cadmium chloride solutions or injected with 8.5 mu g cadmium/g body weight. The crabs exposed to cadmium,, either by injection or immersion, were less able to bring about dispersion of the pigment in their integumentary melanophores than were the unexposed crabs. Cadmium did not affect the;melanophores directly. This decreased black pigment dispersion was apparently due to effects of cadmium on the neuroendocrine processes that control the melanophores. The neuroendocrine complex in the eyestalk is the source of a black pigment-dispersing hormone (BPDH). Eyestalks of crabs kept in clean water contained 3.27 times more BPDH than did the eyestalks of the cadmium-exposed crabs. Histological studies revealed that cadmium exposure results in depletion of the neurosecretory material in the eyestalks and brain. It is hypothesized that cadmium inhibits BPDH synthesis in neurosecretory (neuroendocrine) cells, resulting in decreased ability of exposed crabs to disperse their black pigment.

AB  - Populations living in contaminated environments may exhibit behavioral changes that can alter predator-prey interactions. Blue crabs from the contaminated Hackensack Meadowlands (HM) had reduced ability to capture juvenile blue crabs and adult mummichogs (both active prey) compared with crabs from a reference site (Tuckerton (TK)). However, they consumed equivalent amounts of ribbed mussels and fiddler crabs, which are less active prey. Crabs may have reduced coordination rather than appetite or motivation. The lab data are supported by stomach analysis of field-caught crabs. HM crab stomachs contained similar to 60% algae, plant material, detritus, and sediment and much lower weights of crab, fish, and other live food than TK crabs. However, the relative absence of bivalves in their diet may reflect reduced amounts available. When TK crabs were caged in HM or fed food from HM in the lab for 8 weeks, their prey capture ability declined significantly, and mercury in their muscle tissue increased significantly, indicating that environmental factors were responsible for the behavioral differences. When HM crabs were caged in TK or fed fish from TK in the lab for 8 weeks, their prey capture ability improved significantly. Mercury levels were variable and did not show a significant decrease.

AB  - Intertidal sandflats inhabited by fiddler crabs are ideal systems in which to study the effects of physical and biological processes on communities. This study had 3 objectives: (1) to identify the environmental factors that regulate foraging in the sand fiddler crab Uca pugilator; (2) to determine the effects of fiddler crab foraging and tidal inundation on a sandflat community in a single tidal cycle in spring, summer and fall; and (3) to determine the effects of fiddler crab foraging on a sandflat community over a period of months. Laboratory feeding assays showed that fiddler crab feeding is regulated by 4 environmental factors. Tide and temperature determine initial activity. U. pugilator feeding is optimal on sediment with the following characteristics: (1) organic content of at least 1.0%; (2) 100% saturation with water resulting in complete dactyl penetration. These conditions occur in a band immediately above the water that moves with the tide. Salinities from 0 to 140 ppt do not affect feeding behavior. In field exclusion/inclusion experiments, fiddler crabs reduced sediment organic content by 40%, Chl a by 20% and meiofaunal density by 60% in one tidal cycle. Effects were most pronounced in the spring when organic content and meiofaunal densities were maximal. The sandflat had highest levels of all variables in spring and minimal levels during summer and fall. Exclusion of crabs caused increases in sediment organic content, Chl a, meiofaunal density and diversity in the first 2 weeks. Organic content, Chl a and diversity remained elevated for the 9 month duration of the experiment. Meiofaunal density decreased after 2 months to ambient levels when mud snails Ilyanassa obsoleta invaded exclusion cages. Organic content and meiofaunal density were high in spring, low in summer and fall. These results indicate that effects of crab foraging accumulate. Crabs graze the sandflat to minimum levels when they become active in the spring. Due to crab foraging, the flat is barren during the summer and fall, and recovers during the winter when crabs are minimally active. Seasonal effects, and predation, competition and disturbance by fiddler crabs structure this sandflat community.

AB  - Intertidal sandflats inhabited by fiddler crabs are ideal systems in which to study the effects of physical and biological processes. This study addressed two questions: (1) Do fiddler crab feeding and tidal inundation have measurable effects on the sandflat over one tidal cycle? (2) Does the sandflat change over the course of a year? In field exclusion/inclusion experiments, fiddler crabs reduced sediment organic content by 40%, Chlorophyll alpha levels by 20% and meiofaunal density by 60% in one tidal cycle. Effects were most pronounced in the spring when organic content and meiofaunal densities were maximal. Effects of foraging were not erased by the tide and accumulated over time. The sandflat had highest levels of all variables in spring and minimal levels during summer and fall. Crabs graze the sandflat to minimum levels in the spring. Due to crab foraging, the flat is barren during the summer and fall, and recovers during the winter when crabs are minimally active. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Sand fiddler crabs Uca pugilator (Bosc 1802) live in burrows in the high intertidal to supratidal zones of sandflats and salt marshes. Large groups of crabs regularly leave their burrows to forage on exposed sediments in the low intertidal zone. They are known to forage in response to chemical cues. We hypothesized that environmental factors that vary predictably in field sediment play a role in determining where fiddler crabs forage. To test this hypothesis, we determined the effects of four physical sediment characteristics on chemically mediated feeding behavior in U. pugilator: (1) sediment organic content; (2) the salinity of interstitial water; (3) sediment grain size; and (4) sediment water content. Our results indicate that sediment organic content and sediment water content are the most important factors that determine where fiddler crabs forage. Optimal sediment is a mixture of sizes dominated by 0.125 and 0.250 mm sands. This condition is constant across the intertidal zone. Salinity, the most variable of the environmental factors, has no effect upon feeding responses. Optimal conditions for feeding are found in sediment with organic content at or above 1.0% that is fully saturated with water. Complete saturation allows the entire dactyl to penetrate the sediment. Consequently, dactyl chemoreceptors are maximally stimulated. Optimal conditions are found in a band several meters wide immediately above the water. The band moves with the tide. Physical factors (sediment water content), rather than biological factors (food content), are responsible for temporal patchiness of the foraging environment of fiddler crabs.

AB  - 1. Nuclear DNA amounts of thirty-eight species of crustaceans, belonging to three subclasses and seven orders, were determined by cytophotometry or by fluorometric assay.
2. DNA contents vary over a wide range (0·7–22·6 pg haploid). A modal value of about 2·5 pg is typical for many groups.
3. The extreme values are found in groups with peculiar morphological adaptations, and the correlation between specialized morphology and low amounts of DNA in barnacles parallels a comparable trend in other invertebrate groups and in vertebrates.

AB  - Courting male fiddler crabs Uca terpsichores (1 cm carapace width) sometimes build mounds of sand called hoods at the entrances to their burrows. Males wave their single enlarged claws to attract females to their burrows for mating. It was shown previously that burrows with hoods are more attractive to females and that females visually orient to these structures. In this study, we test whether males also use their hoods to find their burrows. We first determined the maximum distance that males can see and find a burrow opening without a hood. Males were removed from their burrows and placed on the sand at a range of distances from a burrow opening. If they were more than about 8 cm (seven units of eye-height) away, they were unable find the burrow. In contrast, males that were burrow residents used a non-visual path map to return to their burrows from much greater distances. To determine if hoods help males find their burrows when there are errors in their path maps, we moved residents 1-49 cm on sliding platforms producing errors equal to the distances they were moved. Males with self-made hoods or hood models at their burrows relocated their burrows at significantly greater distances than did males with unadorned burrows. Hood builders also relocated their burrows faster. Hence, hoods have two functions: they attract females and they provide a visual cue that males use to find their burrows quickly and reliably when their path maps fail.

AB  - Fiddler crabs show two different mating modes: either females search and crabs mate underground in male burrows, or males search and crabs mate on the surface near female burrows. We explored the relationship between crab density, body size, the searching behavior of both sexes, and the occurrence of both mating modes in the fiddler crab Uca uruguayensis. We found that crabs change their mating mode depending on their size and crab density. Crabs mated mostly on the surface at low densities, and underground at high densities. The proportion of wandering receptive females but not courting males accounted for the variation in mating modes. This suggests that whether crabs mate underground (or on the surface) is determined by the presence (or absence) of searching females. We found that the change in the mating mode affected the level of assortative mating; males mating underground were bigger than those mating on the surface, suggesting active female choice. Given that fiddler crabs experience multiple reproductive cycles, they are prone to showing behavioral plasticity in their mating strategy whenever the payoffs of using different mating modes differ between reproductive events. Our results suggest that the incorporation of different levels of environmental variability may be important in theoretical models aimed at improving our understanding of the evolution of alternative mating tactics and strategies.

AB  - Among the organic matter ingested by fiddler crabs, microphytobenthos is of fundamental importance because it is their main N source. Microphytobenthos abundance generally develop semilunar changes as the dynamics of tidal exposures and day-night cycle are not held constant across days, modifying the balance between growth and mortality. In this study we explored the coupling between temporal dynamics in microphytobenthos abundance and crab feeding activity. We measured the Chlorophyll a content in the 2 mm surficial sediment surrounding the burrows and the crab feeding activity over two semilunar cycles. Chlorophyll a and crab feeding activity showed biweekly cyclic dynamics. Crabs did not concentrate feeding activity around days with maximum abundance of microhytobenthos. This phase difference between both dynamics could be the result of the crab feeding impact, but a crab experimental exclusion showed that the temporal dynamics of Chlorophyll a content stayed unchanged when feeding activity was removed. Comparisons between fed and unfed sediment suggest that the feeding efficiency changes with tidal dynamic. Crabs achieved more than 50% of Chlorophyll a extraction during days of highest feeding activity, and less than 30% during days of low feeding activity or low microhytobenthos abundance. Furthermore, comparisons of fed sediment between consecutive days indicated that Chlorophyll a was completely replenished during days with high flooding tides, but partially replenished during days near neap tides. Environmental conditions affecting feeding efficiency may select crabs to concentrate feeding activity before days with the highest microhytobenthos abundance. The low feeding impact on microphytobenthos dynamics suggests that fiddler crabs would not control microhytobenthos abundance and thus unable to absorb the increasing eutrophication of studied estuarine areas.

AB  - The roles of sediment characteristics and the pattern of recruitment in influencing the abundance of the fiddler crab Uca uruguayensis on Argentinean mudflats were evaluated. The density of adult crabs showed a patchy distribution related to the sediment thickness (depth at which a layer of fossil shells are buried), but the density of juvenile crabs was not coupled with the density of adult crabs. In a field experiment, fossil shells were removed and the density of crabs significantly increased, which demonstrates that the presence of the layer of shells is a structure that may hinder the establishment of burrows. The density of crabs was related to sediment thickness, sediment torque and organic matter content. The importance of each of these variables was different for adult and juvenile crabs, indicating that the distribution of adult crabs may be caused by mechanisms affecting adult crabs themselves and is not established by the recruitment pattern. Moreover, in a field experiment, the density of juveniles decreased when adult crabs were added, and increased when adult crabs were removed. The morphology of burrows was related to sediment characteristics. Burrows were deeper, longer and more voluminous when sediment thickness was high. The volume of burrows decreased with increasing sediment torque. These results suggest that the morphology of burrows is related to the space available and the ease with which sediment it can be excavated. However, an important amount of variability remained unexplained, suggesting the presence of additional environmental variables or behavioural plasticity not considered by this study. Together, these results demonstrate that the spatial heterogeneity in the environmental factors can be translated to a spatial heterogeneity in the distribution of fiddler crabs.

AB  - Male fiddler crabs compete for access to mates mainly by displaying an enlarged claw. One cost of this large claw is presumed to be higher exposure to predators. The fiddler crab Uca uruguayensis is used as a food source by several Neotropical migratory shorebirds. We investigated whether crab density and male claw-waving behaviour increase predation by shorebirds. The sex ratio of crabs on the surface was strongly male biased. Male crabs showed a daily succession of feeding-waving-feeding activities and their dry mass at the site decreased with a high density of crabs, suggesting stronger male-male competition than at sites with a low density of crabs. Sex-specific predation varied according to shorebird species. The Ruddy Turnstone (Arenaria interpres) preyed intensively on male crabs when they were courting and at sites with a high density of crabs, the Black-bellied Plover (Pluvialis squatarola) and the Lesser Golden Plover (Pluvialis dominica) preyed on crabs of both sexes, and the Whimbrel (Numenius phaeopus) foraged intensively on females. When estimating the net effect of 0 predators, we found that the four shorebird species together were able to consume between 0.1 and 0.2% of the crab population, and consumption did not differ between the sexes of crabs. These mortality rates indicate a low source of mortality, likely unable to produce deviations in the sex ratio of the population. Thus, our results indicate that a trait thought to be sexually selected does not necessarily lead to a disproportionate increase in mortality due to predation.

AB  - We studied the relationships between the habitat use of migratory shorebirds and the spatial distributions of the Southwestern Atlantic Fiddler Crab Uca uruguayensis, polychaetes, sediment characteristics and tidal levels in the Rio de La Plata estuary, Argentina, where U. uruguayensis is one of the most important intertidal species. Crabs have a well-defined patchy distribution that is segregated spatially from that of polychaetes. Crab density on the surface varied across the tidal cycle, reaching maximum values during low tide. Polychaete density decreased with depth but showed no change through the tidal cycle; however, given that sediment penetrability did change during the same period, their availability to probing shorebirds is expected to change. Habitat use by shorebirds followed the spatial distribution of prey; shorebirds that foraged on polychaetes (White-rumped Sandpiper Calidris fuscicollis, Two-banded Plover Charadrius falklandicus and Hudsonian Godwit Limosa haemastica) focused their attention on the areas with the highest densities of polychaetes, whereas species that preyed mostly on crabs (Ruddy Turnstone Arenaria interpres, Whimbrel Numenius phaeopus and Grey Plover Pluvialis squatarola) predominantly used areas with crabs. This segregation occurred particularly during low tide, a period in which polychaetes became fully available. Results show that the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of mudflats in relation to the types and availability of prey has a strong effect on shorebird habitat use.

AB  - Fiddler crabs are organism with an extreme sexual dimorphism. Male crabs have an enlarged claw used for sexual display and combat but not for feeding, which place them in foraging disadvantage when are compared with females. Given that avoiding disturbance (e.g., predators or human activity), courting, and feeding are incompatible behaviors, males should have different time budget to balance all the activities. In this study we experimentally evaluated the hypothesis that males of the Southwestern Atlantic fiddler crab Uca uruguayensis have a sex-specific response to disturbance. We performed an experiment where we applied an artificial disturbance (created by addition of flags). During a tidal cycle we found that males were more affected by disturbance than females. During the ebb tide, more males than females remained into their bur-rows because of the artificial disturbance. After disturbance (i.e., when flags were removed) the male-to-female sex ratio on the surface increased in disturbed plots. However, once disturbance was interrupted the male-to-female sex ratio on previously disturbed plots differed from the observed in control plots, being smaller during the ebb tide and larger during the flood tide. The latter might indicate that male crabs increase their foraging effort to compensate the time they loss for feeding as consequence of disturbance. Disturbance also affected the proportion of courting males, but when disturbance was removed courtship returned to initial values of activity, which indicates that the cost of stop courting may be higher than cost of stop feeding. However, after 27 days of experimental disturbance comparison of body condition (dry weight in relation to their carapace width) showed no effect of disturbance, suggesting that males were able to compensate the decrease in feeding time.

AB  - Mangrove rivulus (Kryptolebias marmoratus) is one of the few species of fish that is semi-terrestrial and able to use exposed intertidal and potentially supratidal habitats for prolonged periods of time. Based on previous work demonstrating frequent use of subterranean crab burrows as well as damp leaf litter and logs, we examined the microhabitat associations of rivulus in a mosquito-ditched mangrove forest on the Gulf coast of Florida near the northern limit of its distribution. We captured 161 rivulus on 20 dates between late April and mid-December 2007 using trench traps. Fish ranged in size from 7 to 35 mm SL. Peak abundance in midsummer coincided with recruitment of a new year-class. The three study sites occurred within 0.5 km of one another, and experienced similar water temperatures and salinities. Nevertheless, they differed in their degree of tidal inundation, standing stock of leaf litter, and density of entrances to fiddler crab burrows. We consistently observed the highest mean catches of rivulus away from permanent subtidal waters of mosquito ditches, at intermediate relative elevations, and where leaf litter was locally abundant. Density of entrances to crab burrows was apparently unrelated to rivulus distribution or abundance in these forests. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - 1. Female fiddler crabs, Uca pugilator, were injected with 1.25 x 10(-9)-1.25 x 10(-7) mol/crab of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, serotonin), dopamine (DA), or octopamine (OA). Crabs administered 5-HT showed increased, dose-dependent ovarian development. Those administered DA or OA did not.

2. Crabs administered 20-mu-g of the 5-HT receptor blocker LY53857 showed less ovarian development than saline-injected controls.

3. The results support the hypothesis that endogenous 5-HT has a stimulatory effect on development of the ovaries in Uca pugilator by releasing gonad-stimulating hormone.

AB  - (Uca (Minuca) burgersi Holthuis, 1967 was studied in the laboratory under the morphological and systematical stand points. One experiment was carried out involving 100 larvae, derived from one ovigerous female collected in the north coast of the State of Sao Paulo, Brazil. The experiment were carried out in a climatically controlled room at 25+-1degree C and steady saltiness of 34permill. The larvae were maintained individually and food consisted of rotifers (Brachionus plicatillis) in the first stage and Artemia sp. in the last stages. Uca (Minuca) burgersi have five or six zoeal stages and a megalopa one. All larval stages were drawn and described in detail. Tables where the morphological characteristic of each stage of the studied species was described are also included. They were compared with the other species found in the bibliography passible of being analyzed. The comparative studies of the larval forms of each species of Uca showed that they presented a great similarity of characteristics whose specific identifications were only possible with the aid of several structures analyzed together. In the other hand, the differences among the genera of Ocypodinae occurring in Brazil are more conclusive, and can be obtained by the analyses of a few characteristics.

AB  - This dissertation investigates aspects of the foraging behavior and ecology of Yellow-crowned Night-Herons (Nycticorax violaceus). The diet of yellow-crowns in the eastern and southern Unites States was determined using collections of prey remains from nest sites, feeding observations and United States Fish and Wildlife Service stomach examination records cards. These sampling methods reveal that crustaceans constitute 97%, 91% and 79%, respectively, of the diet. Although yellow-crowns specialize on crustacean prey, the crustacean species taken vary with habitat. Crayfish (Cambarus clarkii) are common in freshwater habitats in Louisiana and comprise the most abundant diet item of yellow-crowns from that region. In contrast, brachyuran crabs are the major prey of yellow-crowns from coastal saltwater marsh habitats in New York and New Jersey. The foraging behavior of Yellow-crowned Night-Herons was investigated by conducting field observations in New York, New Jersey, Costa Rica and Bermuda. Yellow-crowns tend to use the "stand-and-wait" foraging technique when hunting abundant, clumped, active and spatially predictable prey such as fiddler crabs (Uca pugnax) and land crabs (Gecarcinus lateralis). In contrast, uncommon, dispersed, sedentary and spatially unpredictable prey including prey in tide pools/mudflats elicit "widely foraging" techniques in yellow-crowns. Analyses of prey handling behavior reveal a direct relationship between handling time and: (1) prey width within Brachyura; and (2) prey length within American eels (Anguilla rostrata). Because larger prey items are more difficult to handle and are dropped more frequently than small ones, larger prey are transported away from submerged areas to exposed surfaces as a measure to reduce prey escapes during manipulation. Predator simulation experiments show that fiddler crab availability varies with tidal stage; crabs are most available during high tides when they and their burrows are completely submerged. Consequently, yellow-crowns at my study site forage for fiddler crabs only during high tides. Under low tide conditions, yellow-crowns forage in tide pools/mudflats for adult American eels, small fusiform fishes, polychaetes (Nereis spp.) and subtidal crabs. When relative measures of prey availability based on behavior are incorporated into an energetics model, results show that yellow-crowns forage in the more profitable habitats.

AB  - In an effort to obtain biologically active tyrosine analogs of the octadecapeptide pigment-dispersing hormone (.beta.-PDH) of the fiddler crab Uca pugilator, we have synthesized [Tyr15]- and [Nle15]-.beta.-PDH, as well as eight tyrosine analogs of [Nle15]-.beta.-PDH by the solid-phase method. Each analog was purified to homogeneity by gel filtration, ion-exchange chromatography, and partition chromatography. When tested for melanophore pigment-dispersing activity in destalked Uca, [Nle15, Tyr16]-.beta.-PDH and [Nle15]-.beta.-PDH were found to be 31-fold and 16-fold more potent, respectively, than .beta.-PDH. Somewhat reduced potency was displayed by [N-Tyr,Nle15]-.beta.-PDH (81%) and [Nle15, Tyr17]-.beta.-PDH (26%). All other analogs, including [Nle15, Tyr19]-.beta.-PDH and the four derivatives of [Nle15]-.beta.-PDH obtained through substitution for nonpolar amino acid residues at positions 4, 5, 8, and 11 in the primary structure, showed marked decrease in biological activity (0.01 to 2% potency).

AB  - Larvae of the nematode Skrjabinoclava sp. were found during studies on physiological effects of helminth parasites in the hepatopancreas (HP) of Chasmagnathus granulata (Grapsidae) of Lagoa dos Patos estuary (32o11'S; 52o04'W). In 51 adult males of C. granulata examined, seven specimens of Skrjabinoclava sp. larvae were found, at a prevalence of 13.72%, a mean abundance of 0.14 larvae/examined HP and a mean infection intensity of 1.0 larvae/infected HP. Also, three larvae of the parasite were analyzed from Uca uruguayensis (Ocypodidae) collected in Samborombon Bay, Argentina (36o18'S; 56o48'W). Detailed description of the larvae is presented. This is the first record of a natural infection of Skrjabinoclava sp. larvae in decapod crustacean species. It is hypotethized that C. granulata constitutes an accidental or alternative host to Skrjabinoclava sp. larvae in the studied environment.

AB  - The hepatopancreas of the red-jointed fiddler crab, Uca minax, is a bilateral evagination of the midgut, composed of numerous blind-ending tubules. Groups of these tubules empty into collecting ducts which join to form the main hepatopancreatic duct. Ultrastructural examination of tubules from the hepatopancreas of adult fiddler crabs revealed four major cell types, designated as E, R, B, and F cells. The E cells were found at the apex of the tubule and were assumed to serve as meristematic tissue. The R cells were most numerous and were scattered along the length of the tubule. Characterized by extensive smooth and rough endoplasmic reticulum and abundant lipid and glycogen reserves, the R cell was assumed to function in absorption and storage of the organic products of digestion. The B cells were recognized by the presence of a single, large apical vacuole that likely functioned in the secretion of digestive enzymes into the lumen of the hepatopancreas. The F cells, which contained extensive amounts of rough endoplasmic reticulum, were believed to be responsible for the synthesis of digestive enzymes. Electron microscopy of the hepatopancreas of crabs exposed to naphthalene for 5 days revealed that those cells with abundant membrane lipids (F cells) and abundant storage lipids (R cells) were most altered while those cells having little membrane or storage lipids (B and E cells) were only slightly altered. Furthermore, alterations in the F and R cells were not uniform along the length of the tubule, but increased in severity toward the proximal end.

AB  - Fiddler crabs Uca uruguayensis were collected monthly in Punta Rasa, at the southern end of the Samborombon Bay, Rio de la Plata, Argentina, from February, 1995, to March, 1996. Throughout the study, 1,115 of 12,033 crabs (9.3%) were infested by different developmental stages of the branchial bopyrid Leidya distorta, which is herein reported for the first time as infesting U. uruguayensis. The distribution of this parasite, previously known from New Jersey to Rio de Janeiro, is now extended even farther south, to the mouth of the Rio de la Plata. Prevalence of L. distorta increased as a function of crab size. The newly settled cryptoniscus larvae were found in the space between contiguous gill lamellae after invading a previously uninfested branchial chamber. The cryptoniscus larva transformed into an early juvenile and, after molting one or more times, migrated to the roof of the branchial chamber, where it grew and finally reached the ovigerous condition. Female parasites usually carried cryptonisci or males, eventually both, on their bodies. Males were found in different positions on the females as the latter developed. Crabs housing a mature female parasite frequently bore an unpigmented area on the lateral wall of the branchial chamber. An additional faded area was sometimes observed on the bottom of the eye orbit. Adult female parasites usually produced a subtle lateral swelling on the carapace of the host, this deformation being more marked in smaller crabs than in larger ones. The major chela of the male crabs parasitized by adult females was, on average, 6.5% shorter than that of unparasitized ones. Alterations of the gills of the host were noticed: the adult female parasite had a strong dorsal carina that fitted between the fourth and fifth gills of the crab, displacing them laterally and making contact with the floor of the branchial chamber. The inner surface of the crab branchiostegite bore a large horizontal vessel from which the parasite presumably obtained hemolymph. Besides the bopyrid isopod forming the subject of this report, we found 61 crabs harboring a nematode larva, identified as Skrjabinoclava sp., among the internal organs of the crab.

AB  - Variation in female sperm storage is explained, in part, by the amount of sperm transferred at mating. Laboratory mating experiments were conducted on Eurypanopeus depressus and Rhithropanopeus harrisii from the Chesapeake Bay and Pachygrapsus transversus from Florida, while mated pairs of Uca beebei and U. terpsichores were collected from mudflats in Panama. All experiments and collections were conducted during the summer of 2006 and 2007. More sperm was transferred to larger than smaller females, and by species with long copulation durations (R. harrisii and E. depressus). These two species live in cryptic habitats, have high sperm/egg ratios, and likely store sperm across multiple broods. In contrast, P. transversus and U. beebei mate conspicuously, have short copulations, transfer fewer sperm, and have low sperm/egg ratios. Comparisons of sperm transfer across different mating strategies and habitats provide a better understanding of female sperm storage in the Brachyura.

AB  - Adult females of Panopeus africanus A. Milne Edwards, 1867 and Uca tangeri (Eydoux, 1835) were sampled fortnightly from April 1989 to November 1991 in the Rio San Pedro inlet (SW Spain) to estimate the seasonal timing of their reproductive periods. Planktonic larvae were collected monthly from July 1991 to June 1992 by pumping during nocturnal flood and ebb spring tides to establish seasonal larval abundance patterns. Additional 24 h series of samples were collected in July 1991 and May/June 1992 to analyse larval abundance in relation to the main environmental cycles (diel, tidal and lunar phases, and vertical position in the water column). Both species showed a short, late-spring/summer reproductive period: mature and ovigerous females peaked from May to July. Seasonal occurrences of first zoea larvae also indicated short reproductive periods for both species. First zoea was the most abundant stage, representing 99.5% (P. africanus) and 99.9% (U. tangeri) of all individuals collected. On most sampling occasions, there was a net output of zoea I of both species from the inlet, suggesting that larvae are released in the inlet and exported to the bay. The abundance of the first zoea of P. africanus was higher during high and ebb tides, at night and at the surface of the water column. For this species, there was a significant interaction between lunar phase and diel phase: zoea I were most abundant during nocturnal neap tides. Zoea I of U. tangeri showed greater density at ebb tides; they were more abundant at the surface of the water column during ebb than at high tide, suggesting a vertical migration between these tidal phases. Considerable short-term (consecutive or alternate days) and long-term (interannual) variation in the abundance of larvae was observed for both species, The comparison of our results with the scarce information available on the reproductive periods and larval patterns of both species suggests that, at the northern limit of their latitudinal ranges, water temperature may control the seasonal timing of reproductive periods, but populations under different hydrodynamic regimes (different water conditions) might show peaks of larval release during different diel/tidal/lunar phases; this association of larval release with rhythmic cues may serve as a mechanism that may aid escape of larvae from unsuitable environmental conditions.

AB  - Larvae of the fiddler crab Uca tangeri were reared from ovigerous females from the Gulf of Cadiz, Spain. Development consisted of 5 zoeal stages and a megalopa, with each zoeal stage lasting for approximately 3 days and the megalopa 10 days at preferred 25-degrees-C. A detailed description of larval morphology is given, and comparison is made with other species of Uca for which partial or complete descriptions are available. The zoeal stages of U. tangeri are unique among previously described members of the genus in the possession of lateral carapace spines, the absence of lateral spines having been used previously to separate the zoeae of Uca from those of Ocypode.

AB  - The effect of cadmium chloride (1 mg/L) on oocyte growth of the fiddler crab, Uca pugilator, was studied during the slow vitellogenesis phase of ovarian maturation of this carb, In. vivo experiments were done with both intact and eyestalkless crabs, The intact cadmium-exposed crabs Exhibited a significantly lower oocyte diameter than the controls at the end of the 2-week exposure period, but no significant differences were detected among the eyestalkless crabs, suggesting that the effect of cadmium could be on the sinus gland in the eyestalks, increasing secretion of the gonad- inhibiting hormone (GIH), To test this hypothesis, in vitro experiments were done, incubating pieces of ovary with and without ea eyestalk tissue, in the presence of thoracic ganglion, needed for oocyte growing due to the secretion of the gonad-stimulating hormone (GSH). only when eyestalk tissue was present in the incubation media was oocyte growth inhibited by cadmium compared to the controls, These results strongly suggest that cadmium acts at least in part to increase the secretion of GIH from the sinus gland. GIH could then in turn act by (a) inhibiting secretion of GSH by the thoracic ganglion, (b) directly inhibit the oocytes, or (c) both (a) and (b), (C) 2000 Academic Press.

AB  - Cues associated with biofilms from the adult habitat previously have been found to accelerate metamorphosis in the megalopae of the common mud crab Panopeus herbstii (Milne-Edwards). In this study, we investigated several properties of this biofilm and further investigated the response of megalopae to exudates from adult P. herbstii. Results showed the cue to be water-soluble and suggest that it is associated with the bacterial component of the film. Biofilms from a rocky intertidal area produced a response, while films from an intertidal sand flat did not. When biofilm was allowed to form on clean glass slides in adult habitat, megalopae showed a stronger response to 10-d-old biofilms than to 2-d-old biofilms. Exudates from adult P. herbstii produced a strong response while exudates from prey species Crassostrea virginica and a closely related mud crab Dyspanopeus sayi produced a weaker, but significant response. Exudates from fiddler crabs Uca pugnax did not elicit a response. Results from these experiments suggest that there are multiple water-soluble cues that induce metamorphosis of mud crab megalopae.

AB  - The release of the crustacean hyperglycemic hormone (CHH) is inhibited by synthetic Leu-Enkephalin (L-Enk).

2. Endogenous enkephalinergic material was isolated by reversed phase liquid chromatography.

3. The endogenous substance inhibits CHH release as demonstrated by bioassay in vivo and in vitro.

4. The decrease in CHH release is antagonized by naloxone.

5. L-Enk immunoreactivity is demonstrated in the eyestalk of Carcinus maenas.

6. The results suggest a modulatory role of L-Enk in the control of neuropeptide release.

AB  - The properties of brachyurins, proteolytic enzymes belonging to a new subfamily of chymotrypsin-like proteases, are considered. These enzymes, found in various species of crustacean, exhibit mixed substrate specificity and a marked collagenolytic activity. The enzymatic and physicochemical properties of brachyurins I and their primary and spatial structures are discussed in detail. A separate chapter is devoted to the preparations of collagenases from the hepatopancreas of king crab: their action on the damaged skin and use in medicine.

AB  - Background: In this paper, we describe cDNA cloning of a new anionic trypsin and a collagenolytic serine protease from king crab Paralithodes camtschaticus and the elucidation of their primary structures. Constructing the phylogenetic tree of these enzymes was undertaken in order to prove the evolutionary relationship between them.

Results: The mature trypsin PC and collagenolytic protease PC contain 237 (Mcalc 24.8 kDa) and 226 amino acid residues (Mcalc 23.5 kDa), respectively. Alignments of their amino acid sequences revealed a high degree of the trypsin PC identity to the trypsin from Penaeus vannamei (approximately 70%) and of the collagenolytic protease PC identity to the collagenase from fiddler crab Uca pugilator (76%). The phylogenetic tree of these enzymes was constructed.

Conclusions: Primary structures of the two mature enzymes from P. camtschaticus were obtained and compared with those of other proteolytic proteins, including some enzymes from brachyurans. A phylogenetic analysis was also carried out. These comparisons revealed that brachyurins are closely related to their vertebrate and bacterial congeners, occupy an intermediate position between them, and their study significantly contributes to the understanding of the evolution and function of serine proteases.

AB  - Both raccoons (Procyon lotor ) and Norway rats ( Rattus norvegicus ) may be problem species at Jamaica Bay Unit of Gateway National Recreation Area (GNRA) because of their potential predation on native wildlife. I trapped 54 different raccoons (24m, 30f), calculating an average density of 0.31 raccoons per hectare from 2006-07. Male raccoons were larger in body weight (5.2 kg for males and 5.6 kg for females) and males had larger hind-foot length. Fifteen Norway rats were analyzed (9m, 6f) from two different locations tern nesting area (TNA) and metropolitan transit authority (MTA). TNA total length averaged 31.9 cm for males 36.8 cm for females. MTA males averaged 35.8 cm and 39.2 cm for females. Weight was not taken. Additionally, I determined the consumption of rare species by using fecal and gut analysis, for raccoon and Norway rats respectively. My analysis of 161 raccoon scat samples collected over 13 months demonstrated that fiddler crabs ( Uca pugnax ) were their main food species (79% percent frequency of occurrence (PFO)) followed by plant matter (55% PFO) and mast (e.g. nuts and fruit; 39% PFO), which was similar to other coastal locations. As with similar studies on Rattus spp., vegetation was the most important diet item in 15 rat digestive tracts I examined, but this is poorly resolved due to small sample sizes and the difficulty of identifying gut contents. No government-listed protected species occurred in the samples. However, three exploitable vulnerable plants (American holly, bayberry, prickly-pear cactus) and one species of regional concern, diamond-back terrapin, were consumed by raccoons. The plant species do not appear to be at risk from raccoons or rats, but terrapin eggs and perhaps hatchlings appear to be important raccoon diet items. Similarly, terrapin hatchlings might be seasonally important diet item of rats. Higher resolution diet studies are needed to further quantify the role of problem species as predators of rare wildlife at GNRA.

AB  - Loss and modification of tidal marsh habitat has contributed to the decline of marsh bird species. For many marsh birds that inhabit tidal ecosystems, little information exists on habitat use, particularly in relation to movement and response to prey availability. In this study, radio-telemetry was used to investigate home range size, movement patterns and response of Clapper Rails (Rallus longirostris) to prey availability within tidal marshes in coastal Mississippi. Mean fixed kernel 95% home range for breeding Clapper Rails was 1.37 ha +/- SE 0.27 (N = 10 birds) with a 50% core use area 0.32 ha +/- SE 0.07 (N = 10 birds), which arc estimates similar to those obtained throughout this species' range. The extent of Clapper Rail movements during the incubation period was negatively correlated with density of fiddler crab burrows within 50 m of nest sites. Clapper Rails' use of marsh edge decreased relative to tidal height. Use of this habitat type may have been further restricted during the first few weeks of the parental-care period when adults were caring for recently fledged young. Collectively these results illustrate the importance of edge and interior marsh habitats and may provide an explanation for the variation in Clapper Rail densities found within and between tidal marsh systems.

AB  - A number of small invertebrates occur in the water column of the subtropical estuary. The occurrence patterns of estuarine animals may be more strongly synchronized with the tidal cycle than those of subtidal animals. Sampling was carried out in the estuary at Iriomote-jima (24.5degreesN and 123.7degreesE) in Japan. An impeller pump was fixed 30 cm above the riverbed at the outlet to the sea, and the pump ran continuously for 20 d from 17 June to 8 July in 1999, to precisely assess the influence of the tidal cycle. Collection of small invertebrates was done with a nylon net (mesh size of 300-500 mum). At least 153 taxa were collected, and patterns of numerically dominant 24 taxa (all crustaceans) were inspected. A notable feature was very clear nocturnalism (levels N2 and N3). In addition, there was a wide variety in synchrony with the tidal cycle from very clear patterns (level T3) to no clear patterns (level T0). Most patterns (80%) showed well-demarcated synchrony with the tides (T2 and T3). A variety of synchrony was also observed on the tidal phase. The zoeas of some animals occurred at the receding tide, and those of other animals occurred at around high tide. The timing of their occurrence may be reflected by the site and time of larval release. The water temperature of the tidal flat would highly increase at low water by day, and the seawater is highly transparent in subtropical sea, though the estuarine water is turbid. Planktonic animals would be transported to the sea with the receding tide at night. Nocturnal occurrence may be adaptive to avoid high temperatures and vulnerability to visual predators in the sea during the transport of larvae. All megalopae occurred at the rising tide. They would go upstream using the rising tide. The occurrence patterns of most invertebrates were characterized by the semilunar rhythm. The adaptive function of this rhythm may be related to mating or fertilization rather than survival of the larvae. (C) 2003 Editions scientifiques et medicales Elsevier SAS. All rights reserved.

AB  - The courtship behaviour of the fiddler crabs Uca rapax, U. pugnax, U. mordax and U. speciosa on the Florida peninsula was described. Males of all species increased their rates of waving and often produced sounds when approached by females during the day. Males of all species produced sounds during nocturnal low tides. When touched by another crab, soundproducing males increased the rate and intensity of the sounds and simultaneously moved farther into their burrows. Males of U. speciosa produced sounds by rapping their major cheliped against the substrate and males of the other species by vibrating their ambulatories. It was suggested that the latter mechanism, in addition to other criteria, indicated close relationship between the three species. Rates of sound production at night were quite variable but in most cases were characterized by an early evening peak after sunset. The coastal distribution of all species on the Florida Peninsula was determined.

AB  - Female fiddler crabs (Uca pugilator) showed unconditioned responses (usually, locomotor or ‘startle’ responses) when presented with brief tones (20–9600 Hz) from beneath a cardboard testing platform. Differences in the number of responses elicited by different intensities of the tones were used to establish a provisional audiogram for the crab. Other experiments suggested that the crabs were responding to amplitude displacements of the platform rather than air pressures, at least at the lower frequencies. The crabs were more sensitive to displacements at the higher frequencies, with a rapid increase in sensitivity between 60–2400 Hz. The sensitivity of the females is discussed with reference to their ability to detect the rapping sounds produced by conspecific males.

AB  - Despite growing interest in species' range shifts, little is known about the ecological and evolutionary factors that control geographic range boundaries. We investigated the processes that maintain the northern range limit of the mud fiddler crab ( Uca pugnax) at North Scituate, Massachusetts, USA ( 42 degrees 14' N), located similar to 60 km north of Cape Cod. Larvae from five populations in Massachusetts were reared under controlled temperatures to test whether cooler water near the edge of this species' range inhibits planktonic development. Few larvae completed development at temperatures,< 18 degrees C, a threshold that larvae would regularly encounter north of Cape Cod. Extensive salt marshes are present north of the current range boundary, and a transplant experiment using field enclosures confirmed that benthic fiddler crabs can survive severe winter conditions in this northern habitat. Taken with oceanographic data, these results suggest that the range boundary of fiddler crabs is likely maintained by the influence of cooler water temperatures on the larval phase. Analyses of mitochondrial DNA sequences from a neutral marker ( COI) indicate high gene flow among U. pugnax populations in Massachusetts with little differentiation across Cape Cod. Consistent with predictions regarding the homogenizing influence of gene flow, larvae from source populations north and south of Cape Cod shared a common lower threshold for development. However, larvae produced near the range edge had faster growth rates than those from the south side of Cape Cod ( typically reaching the final megalopal stage 1.0-5.5 d faster at 18 degrees C). Additional studies are needed to determine the mechanism underlying this counter-gradient variation in development time. We hypothesize that dispersal into cooler water on the north side of Cape Cod may act as a selection filter that sieves out slow developers from the larval pool by increasing planktonic duration and exposure to associated sources of mortality. Thus while high gene flow may prevent the evolution of greater cold tolerance in northern populations, recurrent selection on existing variation may lead to an unexpected concentration of favorable adaptations at the edge of the range. Such a pattern could permit edge populations to play a dominant and unrecognized role in future range extensions.

AB  - The in vivo effects of dopamine (DA), a dopaminergic antagonist (spiperone), and a dopaminergic agonist (ADTN) on maturation of the testes in the fiddler crab, Uca pugilator, were determined, DA inhibited testicular maturation dose-dependently. ADTN also inhibited maturation of the testes whereas spiperone induced testicular maturation. These results provide the first evidence for dopaminergic inhibition of testicular maturation in a crustacean. This DA-induced inhibition may have been due to: (a) inhibition of release of the gonad-stimulating hormone, (b) stimulation of release of the gonad-inhibiting hormone or (c) both (a) and (b).

AB  - 1. Male fiddler crabs, Uca pugilator, received injections of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, serotonin). The crabs showed dose-dependent testicular development.

2. Like 5-HT, the 5-HT releaser fenfluramine and the 5-HT potentiator fluoxetine induced testicular maturation also, but the 5-HT receptor blocker LY-53857 did not.

3. The data support the hypothesis that 5-HT exerts this stimulatory effect on the testes indirectly, by triggering release of gonad-stimulating hormone.

AB  - The potential involvement of an endogenous opioid system in the regulation of ovarian development in the fiddler crab, Uca pugilator, was investigated in vivo. Injection of the opioid, methionine enkephalin, into female crabs significantly slowed ovarian maturation in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, injection of the opioid antagonist, naloxone, produced dose-dependent ovarian maturation. These results provide the first evidence that an opioid system is involved in the control of reproduction in a crustacean. It is hypothesized that the opioid (a) stimulates release of the gonad-inhibiting hormone, (b) inhibits release of the gonad-stimulating hormone or (c) does both (a) and (b).

AB  - The thesis deals with the standardization of biological assays of Nle $\sp{4,15}$-PDH (pigment-dispersing hormone), an oxidation-resistant analog of the light-adapting distal retinal pigment hormone (DRPH) of Pandalus borealis. Both in vivo and in vitro assays were conducted. Hormone-induced chromatophoral responses in vivo were unaffected by the time of injection during the diurnal cycle or by the size of the experimental subject. The response varied, however, in relation to factors such as light intensity, temperature, sex of the individual, prior injections, and frequency of injections. The magnitude of the observed differences in potency varied up to four-fold relative to the standard dose-response curve. These studies suggest that certain environmental and physiological conditions have to be controlled during in vivo tests for relative potency estimates, and that the leucophores in isolated legs can be useful in testing PDH in vitro.

AB  - Bioturbation of mangrove sediments by Uca uruguayensis (Nobili, 1901) and U. rapax (Smith, 1870) was compared based on the grain-size composition and organic content in surface sediment around the burrow and feeding pellets in two mangrove zones of the Sao Vicente Estuary, state of Sao Paulo, Brazil. For each species, 25 burrows with active crabs were selected. All pellets within a 15-cm radius of each burrow were carefully collected; samples of substrate were taken; and the crab occupant was excavated, sexed, and measured for carapace width (CW). The number of spoon-tipped setae on the second maxilliped of each species was estimated; U. uruguayensis showed more of these setae than U. rapax. For both species, the sediment post-processed by feeding activity (feeding pellets) showed a similar increase of coarser fractions and a smaller organic content. However. U. uruguayensis was more efficient in removing organic matter (88.1%) from the sediment than U. rapax (37.5%). These results suggest that different numbers of spoon-tipped setae on the second maxillipeds of the fiddler crabs do not affect the potential for grain-size selection, but result in differing abilities to remove organic matter from the sediment.

AB  - Sand fiddler crabs, Uca panacea, were exposed in laboratory habitats to measured concentrations of ULV-grade fenthion via simulated aerial spray at 5% and 50% of field rate application of 6-12 mg fenthion/m(2) (0.05-0.10 lbs fenthion/ acre). Two habitats served as controls, and two habitats served as replicates for each of the test exposures. The aerial application was repeated 12 times between July 7, 1997, and August 15, 1997, during the period of the most active larval production of the crabs. The resulting measured concentrations of fenthion at the surface and in the water were consistently lower than what the application rate would have suggested. Statistical analysis of total, daily larval counts showed a periodicity of approximately 14 days that did not appear to be affected by fenthion, at least at the 5% application rate, where a 15% reduction in larval production was noted by the end of the second hatching cycle and a 25% reduction by the end of the third. Larval production in the habitats exposed to the 50% application rate was reduced by 18% at the end of the first hatching cycle, 77% at the end of the second, and 100% at the end of the third hatching cycle. At the end of the third hatching cycle, adult crab mortality observed at the surface was 0%, 3%, and 20% for the control, 5%-, and 50%-exposure habitats, respectively. Three weeks after the final fenthion application, survival of adult crabs was 100% in the control habitats, 75% in the 5%-exposure habitats, and 3% in the 50%- exposure habitats. Survival of unfed first-stage zoeae released during the night following the sprays averaged 4.6 +/- 0.9, 3.7 +/- 0.9 and 1.7 +/- 0.6 days for control, 5%-, and 50%-exposure habitats, respectively. Forty-eight-hour LC-SOs (nominal) for fenthion exposure of adult crabs submerged in water and for first-stage zoeae were 215 mu g fenthion/L and 0.8 mu g fenthion/L, respectively.

AB  - We are interested in the mechanisms underlying adaptation to load by postural and locomotor systems. Amphibious shore crabs (Carcinus maenas) must routinely accommodate large changes in load as they move in and out of water, where buoyancy supports a large percentage of their weight. More terrestrial crabs, such as fiddler crabs (Uca sp.), are not exposed routinely to such large load changes. By comparing the mechanisms these related animals use to cope with load changes, we hope to gain insights into general principles underlying load accommodation during locomotion. We study these adaptions using electromyography and neurography in freely-behaving animals. We simultaneously videotape the animals and use a commercially-available 3-D motion analysis system to reconstruct limb kinematics. In agreement with previous studies, Carcinus adapts to increased load during walking by increasing the duration of bursts of motoneuronal action potentials during a step, and by increasing the frequency of spikes within a burst. Concomitantly, there are changes in joint angle which may be a mechanism for increasing the mechanical advantage of limb muscles. We are currently investigating whether Uca and the mainly aquatic crab Libinia show similar responses to load increases.

AB  - We are interested in the mechanisms underlying adaptation to load by locomotor systems. Amphibious shore crabs (Carcinas maenas) must routinely accommodate large load changes as they move in and out of water, where buoyancy supports a large percentage of their weight. Terrestrial fiddler crabs (Uca sp) and aquatic spider crabs (Libinia sp) are not routinely exposed to such large load changes. By comparing these species locomoting under water, on land, and under loaded conditions, we hope to gain insights into general principles underlying load accommodation during locomotion. We videotaped crabs freely walking in a behavioral arena and used a commercially-available 3-D motion analysis system to reconstruct limb kinematics. Shore crabs used an alternating tetrapod gait 82% of the time when walking on land and 90% of the time underwater. Fiddler crabs used this gait 90% of the time on land, but only 55% of the time underwater. Spider crabs consistently used a 4-3-2-1 metachronal gait when walking underwater during both loaded conditions (carrying “backpacks” of 1/4 or 1/8 the crab’s body mass) and unloaded conditions. In all species studied, adaptations to load included a decrease in the swing phase of the step cycle. Analyses of individual joints showed that the angular velocities of trailing legs during flexion are much greater on land than underwater. On land, leading leg excursions are much smaller than trailing leg excursions. This suggests that both leading and trailing limbs contribute equally to locomotion under water, but that trailing legs contribute more on land. Joint excursions are also much less variable on land than underwater.

AB  - Zooplankton (> 300 mum) was sampled along a large scale sampling grid off the northeast Brazilian coast from Pernambuco to Ceara State, during the dry season, from February to March, 1995. Additionally, the Itamaraca Estuarine System (IES) (near Recife, Pernambuco State) was chosen for a mesoscale investigation. Export of water masses from the IES was restricted to the reef line, about 6 km from the coast. In spite of this geomorphological and hydrographical barrier, estuarine decapod larvae were exported to about 15 km offshore. On the inshore shelf off Pernambuco State (6 to 15 km offshore), decapod larvae dominated in abundance and biomass. Here, the dominant decapod groups were Brachyura (late-stage unidentified zoeae of type A, and Xanthidae), Caridea, Porcellanidae, Anomura, and Callianassidae. In the IES, the most abundant decapod taxa were: first-stage zoeae of Brachyura (Uca spp., Ucides cordatus, Grapsidae, Xanthidae, and unidentified zoeae of type "A"), Lucifer faxoni, Upogebiidae, Caridea, Acetes americanus, and Anomura. At distances of more than 20 km off Pernambuco and at most stations off Ceara State, the zooplankton was characterized by an oceanic copepod community. The present study confirms the importance of estuarine mangrove ecosystems as sources of food for marine food webs.

AB  - In order to evaluate the importance of mangrove leaf detritus as a food source for decapod crustacean larvae, stable isotopes (delta(13)C and delta(15)N) were measured in the tissue of these larvae and other selected organisms. Decapod crustacean larvae and planktonic adult decapods, Lucifer faxoni and Acetes americanus, were sampled in the Itamaraca estuarine system, Brazil. For comparison with stable isotope values in the estuary, plankton and POM samples were also taken on the adjacent continental shelf. In the Itamaraca estuarine system, delta(13)C of decapod larvae and the holoplanktonic decapods L, faxoni and A. americanus ranged from about -17 to -23parts per thousand (mean: -19.8 +/- 1.5parts per thousand). This indicates that the contribution of mangrove carbon (delta(13)C: -26.8parts per thousand) to larval nutrition was generally negligible. Among decapod larvae, porcellanid zoeae showed relatively low delta(13)C values, while penaeid shrimp postlarvae showed the highest delta(13)C. Porcellanid zoeae were thus the only decapod larvae with a considerable percentage (13 to 40%) of mangrove carbon in their tissue. However, these low values may also be due to a negative isotope shift that occurs during embryogenesis, Feeding experiments with zoeae of Petrolisthes armatus (Anomura: Porcellanidae) and Sesarma rectum (Brachyura: Grapsidae) showed assimilatory shifts of up to 1.0 +/- 0.2parts per thousand for C-13 and up to 1.4 +/- 0.6parts per thousand for N-15. Analysis of embryonic isotope fractionation for 5 decapod crustacean species, P, armatus, S. rectum, Aratus pisonii, Uca thayeri, and U. maracoani, showed that larval tissue was C-13-depleted by up to 3.8parts per thousand and N-15-depleted by up to 2.3parts per thousand in relation to parental tissue.

AB  - Uca pugilator, the sand fiddler crab, is a deposit-feeder. It feeds on exposed sand flats as the tide recedes. Feeding movements am evoked by stimulation of chemoreceptors on the dactyls. Previous studies have demonstrated that a proteinaceous factor associated with the sinus gland region inhibits chemically-stimulated feeding behavior. Here, that work is extended to show the existence of a similar inhibitory factor present in the hemolymph of fed crabs in the laboratory and in the hemolymph of crabs returning from feeding in the field. The factor is not detected in fasted laboratory crabs or in field crabs walking from burrow areas to feeding sites. Injection of glucose results in inhibition of feeding activity in intact crabs. Injection of glucose, but not galactose, stimulates feeding in eyestalk-ablated crabs. We suggest that neural responsiveness is stimulated by glucose, and that elevated glucose in intact crabs results in release of feeding inhibitory factor from the sinus gland. Release of feeding inhibitory factor into the blood enables crabs to return to burrow areas without stopping when they encounter food-laden sediments.

AB  - Uca pugilator (Bosc 1802) is a deposit-feeding semiterrestrial crab. Feeding is mediated by dactyl chemoreceptors and stimulated by hexose sugars. Eyestalk ablation increases sensitivity of crabs to hexose stimulants. Here, the potential for endocrine control of feeding responses to external chemical stimuli was examined. Injection of extracts from the sinus gland region of the eyestalk into ablated crabs reduced chemically stimulated feeding responses to levels found in intact crabs. Feeding inhibitory factor was found in the sinus gland region of shrimp and crabs. The active factor is 5000-10000 Da in molecular size, and is sensitive to heat and trypsin. These results suggest that the sinus gland contains a proteinaceous factor that can control feeding.

AB  - This paper describes the morphological and mechanical characteristics of the chelae of Callinectes sapidus, together with the predation techniques, handling times and prey size selection of this voracious predator when presented with marsh mussels, Geukensia demissa, or fiddler crabs, Uca pugilator, in laboratory aquaria. Callinectes sapidus is heterochelous but differences in claw size and mechanical advantage between male and female crabs are statistically indistinguishable. Handling times for mussels and fiddler crabs increased steeply with prey size. Fiddler crabs are intrinsically more profitable than mussels, but the relative costs of capturing mobile prey, or excavating mussels, in natural populations is unknown. Previous laboratory experiments investigating the key stimuli used by C. sapidus when selecting prey are reviewed, and their results are compared with behaviour predicted by optimal foraging theory. It is concluded that crabs respond to the strongest stimuli received from the prey. Items were rejected after a given persistence time if the attack proved unsuccessful. Persistence time, however, was adjusted through experience to expectations of local prey quality and availability. The integrated result of this key-stimulus mechanism will be a close match to diets predicted by other behavioural models, including that based on optimal foraging theory.

AB  - The Dampier Archipelago is an inundated landmass similar in topography to the present hinterland. A gently rising undulating submerged plain now occurs 5-20 m below mean sea level (e.g., Mermaid Sound). Inundated hills and ridges rise up from this plain, the lowest forming subtidal rocky reefs, the highest forming the numerous islands of the archipelago. Much of the coastline is igneous rock of Precambrian age. Pleistocene limestone is locally plastered on to this rock. Overlying all rock types is a veneer of varying thickness of sand, gravel or mud deposits. Each of these substrate types occurs in a range of locations which vary according to height above or below mean sea level, topographical configuration and exposure to waves and currents. Consequently there is a wide range of geomorphic units within the archipelago which include intertidal and subtidal rocky shores, intertidal and subtidal limestone pavements, intertidal flats, intertidal beaches and subtidal plains. Habitats are intimately linked to geomorphic units and each habitat type suppports its own characteristic assemblage of marine organisms. Biotic assemblages have been broadly grouped into categories based on the most common or noticeable species within the group. These assemblages are: oyster-barnacle, coral, mangal, Notocallista-echinoderm, demersal fish-echinoderm-crustacean, Donax-crustacean, Uca-cerithid, Mictyris, Uca-Macrophthalmus, xanthid-sponge, Ocypode, seagrass, algae, embayment fish and pelagic fish-plankton.

AB  - Linear mixed models are a popular tool for analysis of data with within-subject dependence. Such data include longitudinal data, repeated measurements data and method comparison data. The standard version of mixed models assumes normality for both random effects and error distributions. However, this assumption is often violated in practice. In particular, there may be skewness and/or heavy tailedness in the data. Ignoring serious departures from normality may reduce the accuracy of parameter estimates. Recently there has been substantial interest in developing robust extensions of standard mixed models that assume various generalizations of the normal distribution as the distribution for random effects and errors. But none of the existing generalizations allows the two distributions to differ in heaviness of tails. This situation arises when only the errors have heavy tails but not the random effects and vice versa -- a common scenario in practice. The main goal of this dissertation is to overcome the aforementioned limitation by developing a robust mixed model that assumes a multivariate skew-t distribution for random effects and an independent multivariate t-distribution for errors. This model simultaneously captures skewness and heavy tailedness in data, while allowing the random effects and error distributions to have different degrees of freedom. The new model offers considerable flexibility in modeling of data, thereby broadening the scope of mixed models. We derive some key properties of this model and develop an EM-type algorithm for fitting it. We also perform a simulation study to compare it with existing models. The simulations show, in particular, that the new model leads to more efficient estimates of variance parameters than the recent skew-t mixed model when the heavy tailedness is only either in random effects or in errors. As an application of the new model, we focus on modeling and analysis of method comparison studies. These studies are concerned with evaluation of agreement in two or more competing methods of measuring a continuous variable to determine whether the methods can be used interchangeably. We adapt the existing methodology for agreement evaluation based on mixed models by modeling the method comparison data using the proposed model. We also illustrate the application of this methodology by analyzing a real method comparison study involving measurement of lengths of claws of fiddler crabs ( Uca mjoebergi ).

AB  - An enormously developed giant cheliped with the other small one characterizes the adult male fiddler crab. Some experiments with artificial severances of cheliped indicate that such a handedness in the cheliped size is maintained even after the regeneration of severed cheliped. Other experimental researches give some results about an unknown physiological system which controls the emergence and the regeneration of the handedness in the cheliped size. In this paper, with two hypothesized factors relevant to the regeneration of a severed cheliped, we propose a simple mathematical model to describe the experimental result about the cheliped regeneration with a handedness after the cheliped severance for the fiddler crab. Our model gives a suggestion about an underlying system for the cheliped regeneration in the fiddler crab or some other crustacean species.

AB  - The abundance of the megalopae of Callinectes sapidus, Uca spp., and Libinia spp. and the post-larvae of Penaeus spp. settling on collectors hung from the end of the Army Corps of Engineers' Field Research Facility (FRF) pier in Duck, North Carolina, USA, was measured daily during the period 2 August through 3 November 1994. During this period the coastal oceanography was dominated by the effects of the winds; winds from the NE tended to generate surface onshore now and downwelling while those from the SW tended to generate surface offshore flow and upwelling. If the post-larvae were transported shoreward by coastal currents then variations in their abundance should relate to the physical parameters which generate the transporting currents. Using time-series analysis the daily abundance of post-larvae was statistically analyzed and compared to along- and cross-shore wind stress, along- and cross-shore current speed near the bottom (23 m) and near the surface (4 m), and temperature, salinity, and current speed measured at the end of the FRF pier. Fourier analysis suggested that the abundance of post-larval C. sapidus and Penaeus spp. varied on a semi-lunar cycle, e.g. 15 d. No cycles were apparent in the Fourier analysis of the abundance of Uca spp. megalopae and the megalopae of Libinia spp. varied on an 18 d cycle. Significant cross-correlations were found between the log-transformed daily abundance of post-larval C. sapidus and Penaeus spp. and the maximum daily tidal range, which, coupled with the Fourier analysis, suggests that peak catches of these postlarvae tended to occur at and just after the spring tides. The cross-correlation analysis suggests that abundance of Uca spp. megalopae was weakly related to the tides, with peak catches tending to occur around the spring tides. No significant cross-correlations were found between the abundance of Libinia spp. megalopae and the maximum daily tidal range. To test for the effects of the other physical variables on post-larval abundance Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models were fitted to the biological and physical data, and cross-correlations were run between the residuals from these models. The analysis suggests that the abundance of C. sapidus megalopae did not vary with any of the measured physical variables, Penaeus spp. and Uca spp. tended to be more abundant during periods of onshore surface now and downwelling, while Libinia spp. megalopae tended to be more abundant during periods of offshore surface flow and upwelling. The results of this study suggest that post-larval C. sapidus and Penaeus spp. were transported shoreward by tidally driven processes, both Penaeus spp. and Uca spp. were transported shoreward by wind-driven surface currents, and Libinia spp, megalopae were transported shoreward in near-bottom waters during upwelling events.

AB  - Trematode parasite infection was investigated in four species of brachyuran crabs in the Waka-river and one species in the Kinokawa-river, Wakayama City. The encysted trematodes were artificially excysted and identified. Microphalloides japonicus (Osborn, 1919) (Trematoda: Microphallidae) was found in Helice tridens (Decapoda: Varunidae) and Spelotrema capellae (Yamaguti, 1939) (Trematoda: Microphallidae) in Hemigrapsus penicillatus (Decapoda: Varunidae) and Macrophthalmus japonicus (Decapoda: Macrophthalmidae). Since Macrophalloides japonicus had been reported in several species of crabs including H. tridens in Kyushu, Shikoku and Chugoku districts, this research adds a further eastern location of distribution (Kinki district) of this trematode. And this is the first record of H. penicillatus and Macrophthalmus japonicus as second intermediate hosts of S. capellae. Infection rates were 53.8% in Macrophthalmus japonicus (n=13), 63.6% in H. penicillatus (n=11), 71.4% in H. tridens (n=14), 0% in Uca lactea (Decapoda Ocypodinae) (n=10) and Ilyoplax pusilla (Decapoda: Dotillidae) (n=10). The difference of infection rate probably resulted from distribution and behavior of the crabs such as degree of residence to the burrows, inducing different predation rates by shorebirds and the definitive hosts of the trematodes.

AB  - Uca formosensis Rathbun, 1921 is an endemic fiddler crab from Taiwan. The taxonomy of this species has long been constrained by the paucity of specimens in major museums. It is necessary to conserve this species by understanding its natural history as most of its habitat are under threat. The aim of this study was to investigate the systematics of the species using morphological, biochemical, behavioral and ecological approaches. Females generally have an enlarged tooth on each finger of the minor chelipeds. In contrast, males lack teeth on both fingers of the minor chelipeds. The ratio of handedness of chelipeds is the same (50 : 50) for males. Variation on the anterolateral margins of the carapace, suborbital margin, orbital floor and the living coloration were also studied. Results from characters such as handedness, presence of enlarged teeth on the fingers of the female's minor chela, structures of the anterolateral margin, suborbital margin, orbital floor, degree of arching of the carapace and habitat preference suggest that U. formosensis is different from the other members of the subgenus Thalassuca (U. tetragonon and U. vocans). Population genetics of U. formosensis from six sites were compared by allozyme analysis. The average genetic differentiation coefficient (FST) was 0.030, implying that there was little genetic differentiation among the crabs from various sites. The average genetic distance (D) among populations was as low as 0.0015. However, the genetic distance between Chiku population and all other populations was much higher. Since Chiku habitat was an isolated fish pond, the differentiation is probably caused by the low gene flow with other sites and the founder effect. Some allele frequencies of the populations from mangrove habitats of Chuwei and Tungshih were different from the rest of populations. The genetic distance from allozyme analysis indicated that U. formosensis was close to the subgenus Deltuca. U. formosensis is therefore suggested to be placed in the subgenus Deltuca. The results of the behavioral study indicate that U. formosensis posses two types of mating system: surface mating and underground mating. In surface mating, males tried to approach those neighboring females having their own burrows without exhibiting courtship behavior. Mating sites were the surface near the burrow of females. After the mating, the participants returned to their own burrows. Feeding continued after mating. In underground mating, the male vigorously waved the major cheliped to attract the wandering female and directed approaching female to his burrow with his carapace facing toward her (the back-pushing behavior). When a female went into a male's burrow, male followed her immediately, which is a "female-first" type of courtship. Some males displayed a bout of shivering behavior with their major chelipeds before they followed the females into the burrows. Underground mating males were larger than the females, but there was no significant correlation between the size of the pairs. After successfully attracting the female into his burrow, the male would build a large chimney in face of the drought period before next of the coming neap tide. The construction of chimney after pairing is first reported in the present study. It is not related to sexual attraction. Chimney was not for sunshading or ventilation because its entrance was plugged and the burrow bottom was not located just below the entrance. Chimney provides a moist burrow for the ovigerous female to hatch her eggs. Usually the male dug a large and deep burrow reaching the water table to accommodate the pair. The pellets dug out were conveniently put beside the entrance without any special purpose. Piling up of the substrate to chimney shape was likely to prevent the builder from its enemies. From the survey undertaken between 1994 to 1997, U. formosensis was only found in Taiwan and Penghu. Its zoogeographical distribution was limited and scattered, because most habitats were threatened by development. Habitats with large population of U. formosensis were usually open and less sheltered shores with gray clayey mud, e.g., Haishanku, Shenkang and Chiku; while small population occurred in those habitats with dense mangrove, e.g., Chuwei, Chinshui, Fangyuan, Tungshih and Chinglo.

AB  - Chimney building by male Uca formosensis Rathbun, 1921 (Crustacea: Decapoda: Ocypodidae) after pairing: a new hypothesis for chimney function. Zoological Studies 44(2): 242-251. The construction of a chimney after pairing is first described for Uca formosensis Rathbun, 1921, a fiddler crab endemic to Taiwan. After attracting a female into his burrow, the male builds a chimney averaging 9.2 cm high and 7.7 cm in diameter at the base within a 4- or 5-d period before the next neap tide. It is not related to sexual attraction because the chimney does not appear prior to or during courtship. To build the chimney, the male excavates the burrow which probably widens the shaft and, more importantly, deepens the burrow so that it reaches the water table, thus providing a moist chamber in which the female can incubate her eggs. The mudballs dug out from within the burrow are piled around the entrance and form the chimney, which herein is assumed to function as a way for the builder to hide from its enemies. The sex ratio of U. formosensis present on the surface was also recorded and is discussed.

Uca formosensis Rathbun, 1921, is an endemic fiddler crab species from Taiwan. The taxonomy of this species has long been constrained by the paucity of study material. Crane (1975) placed U. formosensis as a member of the subgenus Thalassuca, but important characters, like its handedness. presence of enlarged teeth on the fingers of the female's minor chela, structures of the anterolateral margin, suborbital margin, orbital floor, degree of arching of the carapace, and habitat preference, suggest that this classification is incorrect. It is suggested that U. formosensis should be excluded from the subgenus Thalassuca. In this study, a historic review is provided of the species and notes on its distribution, variation of morphology (chela types), live coloration, and taxonomy are included.

AB  - The fiddler crab fauna (Brachyura: Ocypodidae: Uca) of China is reviewed. Thirteen species are recognised here, viz. Uca acuta (Stimpson, 1858), U. annulipes (H. Milne Edwards, 1837), U. arcuata (De Haan, 1835), U. borealis Crane, 1975, U. coarctata (H. Milne Edwards, 1852), U. crassipes (Adams & White, 1848), U. dussumieri (H. Milne Edwards, 1852), U. lactea (De Haan, 1835), U. paradussumieri Bott, 1973, U. tetragonon (Herbst, 1790), U. triangularis (A. Milne-Edwards, 1873), U. typhoni Crane, 1975, and U. vocans (Linnaeus, 1758). Two females of U. typhoni collected from southern Hainan Island represent the first record of this species from China and East Asia. Two males of U. tetragonon collected from southern Hainan also represent a new record for China. The Uca fauna of southern Hainan is biogeographically distinct being different from those of northern Hainan and continental China, with U. annulipes, U. tetragonon, U. typhoni, and U. vocans common in Southeast Asia. In addition, continental China also lacks some insular species such as U. coarctata, U. formosensis Rathbun, 1921, U. jocelynae Shih, Naruse & Ng, 2010, U. perplexa (H. Milne Edwards, 1837), and U. tetragonon which are common in the East Asian islands of Taiwan and the Ryukyus.

AB  - Fiddler crabs (genus Uca) with broad-fronts (BF) belong to a group of small-sized species with complex behaviors and have been suggested to be more "advanced" compared to the narrow-fronted species groups. Three Indo-West Pacific subgenera, Austruca Bott, 1973, Cranuca Beinlich & von Hagen, 2006, and Paraleptuca Bott, 1973, are reappraised using two mitochondrial (16S rRNA and cytochrome oxidase I) and one nuclear (28S rRNA) markers. The phylogenetic analyses show that the three clades agree relatively well with the three subgenera as currently defined. Our study confirms that the Indo-West Pacific BF species that had been placed with the American Celuca sensu Crane, 1975, are genetically unsupported, and should be classified in Austruca, together with U. sindensis (Alcock, 1900) (currently in Paraleptuca). Austruca now contains 11 species. Cranuca, a subgenus established with only U. inversa (Hoffmann, 1874), is supported by its monophyly and its significant distance from other subgenera. In addition, Paraleptuca (= Amphiuca Crane, 1975) is restricted for U. chlorophthalmus (H. Milne Edwards, 1837), U. crassipes (White, 1847) and U. splendida (Stimpson, 1858). The two American BF subgenera, Minuca Bott, 1954 and Leptuca Bott, 1973, form a mixed clade and further studies will be needed to clarify their validities.

AB  - The fiddler crab, Uca splendida (Stimpson, 1858) has been synonymized under Uca crassipes (White, 1847) since Crane (1975). Studies of specimens from the Hong Kong type locality and adjacent areas of China, Taiwan and Vietnam show that U. splendida is a valid species, with a characteristic suite of carapace and gonopod features as well as a distinct cytochrome oxidase I (COI) signature. Genetic work shows that U. splendida belongs to a well-supported clade and is the sister species of U. crassipes. The distribution of U. splendida is restricted to continental East and continental Southeast Asia, in contrast to the oceanic distribution of U. crassipes. Both species, however, are sympatric in Penghu Islands, western Taiwan and Dongsha Island (=Pratas Island).

AB  - We study the temporal variation in amount of progesterone-like substance in tissuesof the fiddler crab, Uca vocans borealis. Both HPLC and radioimmunoassay (RIA) were employed to determine the amount of a progesterone-like substance in extracts of ovary and hepatopancreas. The results show that, during the breeding period (egg-carrying, January-September), the progesterone-like substance concentrations in ovaries and in hepatopancreases of the crabs studied were 13.8-29.3and 7.7- 17.2 ng per gram of tissue, respectively; while the values dropped to 1.0-2.1 and 4.8-6.8 ng per gram of tissue, respectively, during the nonbreeding period (non-egg-carrying, October-December).

AB  - In tidal flat sediments, larger invertebrates often modify the sedimentary environment in a manner that causes smaller animals, such as meiofauna, to become more abundant. In other words, macrofauna can "promote" meiofauna. In summer (August) and autumn (November/early December) 2007, we investigated centimetre-scale horizontal and vertical profiles of total metazoan meiofaunal abundance and community structure around burrows of Uca lactea (De Haan, 1835) (fiddler crabs) and Scopimera globosa (De Haan, 1835) (sand bubbler crabs) on an intertidal sandflat of the Amakusa Islands, western Japan. Meiofaunal community structure changed significantly with sediment depth around burrows of U. lactea in both seasons, whereas vertical differences were less clear for S. globosa. Although no evidence was found that total meiofaunal abundance or the abundances of certain taxonomic groups were positively influenced by burrows of S. globosa, the abundance of nematodes in subsurface sediment around burrows of U. lactea was significantly higher than in controls in autumn. High concentrations of fresh organic matter had not accumulated in the sediment around burrows of either species of crab. Uca lactea, however, made its burrows in significantly finer sediment than did S. globosa. One possibility is that differences in meiofaunal distribution in sediment around the burrows of the two crabs were the result of habitat and behavioural differences between the species.

AB  - The distribution and coexistence of the fiddler crabs U. vocans borealis and U. lactea lactea was investigated in the upper shore of a sandy beach with respect to particle size, water content and total organic carbon content of the sediments. A clear segregation of habitats between the two species was apparent. U. lactea lactea were only found in sediments with significantly lower total organic carbon content. U. lactea lactea had a higher ratio for the size of third maxilliped to body size than U. rocans borealis. There was no statistical difference in the median sediment particle size of the habitats where both species were found on the study shore. U. lactea lactea was larger on shores where U. vocans borealis were absent. Smaller U. vocans borealis individuals occupied sediments with higher water content and finer particles. Smaller individuals of U. vocans borealis also possessed fewer spoon-tipped setae on second maxilliped than their larger conspecifics, which were found mostly on coarser sediments. U. lactea lactea spent significantly more time on the surface than in the burrow during low tide when compared with U. vocans borealis. Both Uca species exhibited similar desiccation resistance. U. lactea lactea tends to keep its frontal region in close contact with sediments to maintain moisture when being exposed to air.

AB  - Supratidal, intertidal, and subtidal crustacean burrowers produce extensive 3-ft deep open networks in muddy marine sediments which can remain open beneath overburdens exceeding 8 feet. Burrows commonly become infilled, but compaction of either filled or open burrows has not been observed. Resemblances of Recent burrow networks to ancient reef-associated Stromatactis and 'reef-tuba' structures suggest burrows as the origin for these debated structures. 'Nested-cone' structures in cross-bedded oolite of Pleistocene age were probably produced by an anemone like the Recent form Phyllactis. Such structures can be used to differentiate between marine- and eolian deposited sands. Grain-size analysis of extensively burrowed sediments may give little information regarding energy level of the depositional environment. Polyester plastic casts of burrow networks have aided greatly in this study.

AB  - Although the fiddler crab Uca arcuata (De Haan, 1833) has been widely recorded from Kii Peninsula, central Japan to Okinawa Inland, the local populations of this species have seriously declined recently. In the Red Data Book of Japanese marine and freshwater benthic animals in 1995, this species was listed in "RARE' category, which means the species with small population and at risk of extinction. Our recent investigations (2000-2001) recorded small populations of this species in the estuaries of the Koya and Imazu rivers (Yamaguchi Prefecture) and the Nagae River (Okayama Prefecture) in Chugoku District. In the Koya River, the average density was 3.7 individuals per m2 and the estimated number of individuals inhabited was 65100. These numbers indicate that the population size in this locality was as large as that of the Hikawa River in the Ariake Inland Sea, Kyushu, western Japan.

AB  - To evaluate the effect of selective ditching for mosquito control on productivity, unditched and ditched sections of short form Spartina alterniflora Loisel, marsh were sampled in New Jersey [USA]. Standing vegetational biomasses, densities of fiddler crabs (Uca pugnax), isopods (Philoscia vittata) and salt marsh snails (Melampus bidentatus) were sampled 3 and 4 yr after the marsh was ditched. Significantly higher total (live and dead) vegetational biomasses were found in the mosquito ditched marsh (1462.3 dry g/m2) compared to that of the unditched marsh (852.5 dry g/m2). This difference was probably the result of the increase in tidal circulation and possible N fixation in the ditched marsh. The mosquito ditched marsh seemed to be progressing towards a more productive-low marsh community as evidenced by significant increases in fiddler crab holes and isopod densities, decreases in salt marsh snail densities and increases in individual S. alterniflora stem biomasses.

AB  - Estuarine intertidal zones are characterized by variable salinity regimes due to seasonal and daily fluctuations. Salt-marsh inhabitants, as the mud fiddler crab Uca pugnax, are physiologically adapted to this habitat. Crustacean growth and development are energy demanding and sensitive hormonal processes which are susceptible to natural stressors. This study investigated physiological and metabolic changes in the molt cycle of U. pugnax in response to different salinity levels by assessing the survival, respiration, and post-molt tissue protein and carbohydrate content. Crabs were subjected to a limb regeneration and ecdysis challenge under four different salinity regimes. For the study, a limb was removed and its regenerative growth was photographed every two days. After ecdysis, crabs were dissected, and the tissues collected were analyzed for their protein and carbohydrate contents. Crabs held at 60 and 75 ppt seawater showed 100% mortality. Crabs at 60 ppt did not undergo basal limb growth. During limb regeneration, abnormal limb growth Occurred solely in males. Post-molt 40 ppt crabs showed elevated respiration rates compared to 10 ppt crabs. Females and 25 ppt crabs had significantly more free carbohydrates in epithelial tissue than males and crabs at 10 and 40 ppt. As salinity decreased, epithelial protein content in females decreased while males experienced no change. Salinity did not affect the amount of acid, water or base-soluble exoskeleton protein. These physiological responses indicate that U. pugnax males and individuals exposed to extreme salinities arc more likely to be impacted by salinity stress during limb regeneration and ecdysis.

AB  - Brachyurid species have various coloration patterns that fluctuate among individuals due to behavioral interactions or a changing environment. In the fiddler crab Uca pugilator, the historical notion is that color change is regulated by circadian rhythms. In this study, color patterns of U. pugilator were affected by changes in temperature; crab carapaces become light in warm temperatures and dark in colder temperatures. The response to temperature occurred within 15 min (often within 5 min of exposure to the treatment), suggesting that temperature may play a key role in color change, and it is activated not through a hormonal pathway, but rather a direct response of the chromatophores. Color change occurred differently between day and night for each sex, which implies that endogenous rhythms are not the sole mechanism for color change in U. pugilator. Both sexes became darker in the cold treatment, however there were differences between the sexes with high temperatures. Females did not show significant coloration changes, while males became significantly lighter and more speckled. Results from this study suggest sex-specific constraints in response to temperature that could be associated to morphological body mass to surface area ratios, as males have large cheliped, which may be involved in thermoregulation. Constraints could also be associated to different diel activities that each sex performs or visual cues associated with mating behaviors. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Instances of mutualism and commensalism between alpheid shrimp and other marine invertebrates and fish are common in tropical waters. In this study, we present evidence that the temperate alpheid big-clawed snapping shrimp (Alpheus heterochaelis) participates in a symbiosis with the black-clawed mud crab (Panopeus herbstii), which constructs and maintains burrows in salt marshes of mid-Atlantic states, U.S.A. We surveyed eight mid-Atlantic salt marshes and found that 11% of occupied crab burrows (n = 1042) also housed Alpheus. Feeding trials showed that whereas Panopeus readily consumes other marsh Crustacea (i.e., grass shrimp and fiddler crabs), it will not prey on snapping shrimp. Alpheus caged in the marsh without access to mud crab lairs could not construct burrows. These results suggest that alpheid shrimps, thought to be limited in distribution to unvegetated mudflats and oyster reefs, may expand their intertidal range by living commensally with Panopeus herbstii in salt marsh habitats.

AB  - Phylogeographic patterns in Uca annulipes sampled from 30 locations across an East African latitudinal gradient were investigated using mitochondrial DNA cytochrome oxidase I sequences and analysed together with patterns of morphometric differentiation. Four hundred and four specimens along the east African coast were sampled, and 18 haplotypes were encountered. Haplotype and nucleotide diversity values were very low and the phylogenetic analysis did not reveal any clear phylogeographic structure. Furthermore, the analysis of molecular variance and pairwise I broken vertical bar (ST) values showed no significant spatial population differentiation. Mismatch analyses and tests of neutrality supported the hypothesis that this species has undergone a fairly recent demographic expansion. Our results, therefore, failed to demonstrate significant geographical structure in the pattern of genetic variation, indicating that populations of U. annulipes are capable of extensive gene flow among mangroves along the coast. The genetic structure of this species could be panmictic due to a high amount of gene flow along the geographical gradient in study during the planktonic larval phase, when larvae are carried along stream by the dominant currents. Moreover, the morphometric analysis performed did not reveal differences of shape differentiation according to a geographical pattern, although significant differences among the sampling areas were found.

AB  - Ghost crabs are distributed worldwide on sandy beaches, and several studies have associated the number of ghost crab burrows with the levels of anthropogenic impacts on the beaches under study. However, our results show that the use of ghost crab Ocypode quadrata burrows to assess levels of anthropogenic impacts on sand beaches may not be accurate, as previously thought, because the number of burrows does not represent an estimate of the population size. In addition, we propose three hypotheses to explain the extremely low number of individuals/number of burrows ratio: the "secret chamber", the "multiple openings", and the "one crab, several burrows" hypotheses. We also observed an unusual sex ratio.

AB  - A survey regarding the diel and seasonal distribution of brachyuran zoea was accomplished in the Jaguaribe estuary, state of Pernambuco, Brazil. Plankton samples were obtained bimonthly, throughout the year of 2001, in different tides and during day and night periods, at two sampling stations. Fourteen taxa were identified, among which Ocypodidae, represented by Ucides cordatus (Linnaeus, 1763) and Uca spp. zoea, was the most abundant one, followed by Xanthidae and Grapsidae. In the station close to the estuary opening, the taxa were well distributed, besides presenting a larger number of identified families. Ocypodidae, Grapsidae and Morphotype B zoea indicated a dispersion movement into coastal areas, while Pinnotheridae indicated a probable retention within the estuarine waters. The high occurrence of zoea in the first larval stages reinforces the important role of estuaries as nursery grounds for several crustacean species.

AB  - Larvae of many marine decapod crustaceans are released in unpredictable habitats with strong salinity fluctuations during the breeding season. In an experimental laboratory study, we investigated the influence of seven different salinities (0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30) on the survival and development time of fiddler crab zoea larvae, Uca vocator, from northern Brazilian mangroves. The species reproduces during the rainy season when estuarine salinity strongly fluctuates and often reaches values below 10 and even 5. Salinity significantly affected the survival rate and development period from hatching to megalopa, while the number of zoeal stages remained constant. In salinities 0 and 5, no larvae reached the second zoeal stage, but they managed to survive for up to 3 (average of 2.3 days) and 7 days (average of 5.1 days), respectively. From salinity 10 onwards, the larvae developed to the megalopal stage. However, the survival rate was significantly lower (5-15%) and development took more time (average of 13.5 days) in salinity 10 than in the remaining salinities (15-30). In the latter, survival ranged from 80-95% and development took 10-11 days. Given the 100% larval mortality in extremely low salinities and their increased survival in intermediate and higher salinities, we conclude that U. vocator has a larval 'export' strategy with its larvae developing in offshore waters where salinity conditions are more stable and higher than in mangrove estuaries. Thus, by means of ontogenetic migration, osmotic stress and resulting mortality in estuarine waters can be avoided.

AB  - It has recently been shown that metamorphosis of Ucides cordatus megalopae is triggered by substrata from the mangrove forest habitat, and, in particular, adult conspecific odours. Here we demonstrate that the gender of the odour-emitting Crabs is insignificant for the metamorphic response in this species. We further investigate whether other estuarine crabs (Goniopsis cruentata. Uca spp., and Callinectes danae) also induce settlement and metamorphosis of U. cordatus megalopae. This is of special interest for population recovery in areas hit by lethargic crab disease (LCD), a fungus that selectively kills U. cordatus but not co-occurring species. Ucides megalopae were reared in four treatments with interspecific-conditioned seawater and tested against the effects of conspecific-conditioned seawater (positive control) and pure seawater (negative control). All megalopae in the positive control metamorphosed successfully, while only one (2%) moulted in the negative control, with a delay of 10 days compared with the latest metamorphosis in the former treatment. In seawater conditioned with U. maracoani and C danae, which occur on sediment banks and in tidal creeks respectively, all larvae died before reaching the juvenile stage. In the treatments with odours of species that share the same mangrove forest microhabitat as U. cordatus, i.e. G. cruentata and a group of five fiddler crab species (mixed-odour treatment), 20 and 10% respectively of the megalopae moulted with a delay of up to 11 days. No specimens metamorphosed after day 39, but megalopae lived up to 93 days. Since only the conspecific- and coexisting-species treatments stimulated development, we hypothesize that Ucides megalopae are able to precisely identify species-habitat-specific settlement cues. This will be investigated in more detail in future studies, which will also test the effects of the odours of the five forest fiddler crab species separately. The impact of the interspecific odour treatments was much smaller than that of the conspecific odours, nevertheless elevated moulting rates of tip to 18% relative to seawater may still significantly accelerate the repopulation of U. cordatus in areas lacking conspecifics, e.g. after massive crab mortalities or at first colonization.

AB  - Megalopae of many decapod crab species accelerate their development time to metamorphosis (TTM) when exposed to natural physical and/or chemical cues characteristic of the parental habitat. In the present study, the influence of natural settlement cues on the moulting rates and development TTM in megalopae of the fiddler crab Uca vocator was investigated. The effects of mud from different habitats (including well-preserved and degraded-polluted mangrove habitats) and conspecific adult 'odours' (seawater conditioned with crabs) on the induction of metamorphosis were compared with filtered pure seawater (control). 95 to 100% of the megalopae successfully metamorphosed to first juvenile crab stage in all treatments, including the control. However, the development TTM differed significantly among treatments. Settlement cues significantly shortened development, while moulting was delayed in their absence. The fact that megalopae responded to metamorphosis-stimulating cues originating from both adult and non-adult benthic habitats demonstrates that settlement in this species may occur in a wider range of habitats within the mangrove ecosystem, including impacted areas.

AB  - The Socotra Archipelago, situated in the north-western part of the Indian Ocean at the entrance of the Gulf of Aden, has a unique zoogeographical position, as the transition between the Arabian and Red Seas and East African shores. The Socotran marine environment, however, is as yet poorly studied, with only sparse and incomplete reference to the field of crustaceans. The current work presents results from a survey of the intertidal decapod assemblages of Socotra Island conducted in spring 1999. The information from 185 sites sampled around the island is summarized in a map with short descriptions of representative intertidal habitats, their relative area and distribution. Both rocky shores and cobble beaches have the largest diversity of decapods. Sandy beaches are dominated mainly by Ocypode saratan and Coenobita scaevola, whilst rocky shores are dominated by Grapsus albolineatus, G. tenuicrustatus, Plagusia tuberculata, Pachygrapsus minutus, Metopograpsus messor and Eriphia smithii. In cobble beaches, Pseudozius caystrus, Leptodius exaratus, Xanthias sinensis, Clibanarius signatus and Clibanarius virescens are the most common species. Cardisoma carnifex and Uca inversa are common bordering mud flats and coastal lagoons. As fishing pressure is low, mud flats surrounding wadis and coastal lagoons host small undisturbed populations of Scylla serrata and Fenneropenaeus indicus. There is only a reduced number of mangrove trees and area of mangrove, most of which is already destroyed or under severe human and environmental pressure. The largest and most representative stand has an unusual structure: species diversity is strikingly low, it is disconnected from the sea by a sand bar or dune, and is completely dry. Interesting zoogeographical findings are detailed, and a list of intertidal decapod fauna, relating each species to its common habitat is presented. This list is compared with previous studies, and other intertidal decapod assemblages from the Arabian Gulf, Red Sea and East Africa.

AB  - Quantification of mangrove crabs is notoriously difficult. Several techniques have been applied in the past, but have rarely been tested. This paper looks at the use of burrow counts (BUR), binocular counts (BIN) and excavation (EX) for quantifying the fiddler crab Uca annulipes (H. Milne Edwards). Fieldwork took place at Maruhubi mangrove (Zanzibar, Tanzania). Twelve 1 m(2) quadrats were assessed on one spring cycle and one neap cycle. The results showed a strong correlation between carapace width (CW) and burrow diameter (BD), namely CW (mm) = 1.37BD (mm) -0.64 (r(2)=0.98; p <0.001; DF=73). The mean spring tide densities were 77.8 m(-2) (EX), 43.3 m(-2) (BIN) and 104.8 m(-2) (BUR). Of these, 37% (EX), 19% (BIN) and 42% (BUR) were juveniles (<7 mm CW). Census densities did not vary significantly between tides, although total BUR decreased from 1257 (spring) to 949 (neap). Whereas BIN significantly underestimated EX on both tides, BUR only significantly overestimated EX on the spring tide. Overall, burrow quantification matched EX better than binocular counts, suggesting the former is better for the quantification of U. annulipes. Whilst binocular census may be most appropriately carried out on spring tides, burrow quantification may be better on neap tides. A major reason for BIN underestimates and BUR overestimates were discrepancies in juvenile counts. Thus, 28% (spring) to 39% (neap) of adults, but 72% of excavated juveniles were unaccounted for by BIN. Spring tide BUR overestimated excavated adults by 25% but juveniles by 50%. Female BIN matched EX on the spring, but not the neap tide. Male binocular counts were significantly lower than EX on both tides. The potential influences on the results of crab size, sex, emigration and the method of sorting sediment during excavation are discussed.

AB  - Biological rhythms with lunar components are common in nature. In the sea, the moon's gravitational pull on earth is the principal cause of the tides, which normally reach maximum amplitudes every new and full moon. Many populations synchronize spawning to this time. Some choose either the new or the full moon, implying that moonlight is important; but one lunar phase usually has higher tides than the other, and many species select the phase with the higher tide to improve the offshore transport of their progeny. However, tidal dominance by one lunar phase is not constant; it switches between new and full moon every seven months. We tested the influence of this 14-month "syzygy inequality cycle" (SIC) on lunar synchrony by sampling 11 populations of intertidal crabs at two locations in East Africa for 21 months. Eight populations synchronized larval release with the SIC. Tidal cues were more important than moonlight in entraining the reproductive rhythm, although two populations synchronized spawning to the new moon. SIC synchrony increased with population shore level, because only the higher lunar tide permitted top-shore spawning. Top-shore species therefore have a restricted lunar choice. SIC synchrony could be common, given that it occurs in most marine environments.

AB  - Numerous studies have highlighted the importance of crabs within mangrove ecosystems, but tested methods of enumeration are virtually non-existent. The aim of the present study was to assess the accuracy of quick, non-invasive methods for estimating the population density of three species of mangrove crabs in East Africa: Uca annulipes, Sesarma guttatum and Neosarmatium meinerti. Methods employed depended on the behaviour and habitat of each species. Counts of U. annulipes and N. meinerti individuals that were active on the surface (visual counts) and burrow counts (of U. annulipes) were compared to actual densities. Actual densities were determined by excavation of U. annulipes, and by multiplying counts of N. meinerti burrows by the mean number of crabs per burrow. Visual counts of marked individuals of S. guttatum were compared to known densities of marked crabs. For N. meinerti two visual counting methods were tested: (1) instant counts - crabs were counted every 5 min during 0.5 h and the highest count taken; and (2) continuous counts - all burrows were tagged, and those from which a crab emerged during 0.5 h were totalled. For U. annulipes on Inhaca Island (Mozambique) visual counts underestimated excavated numbers by 27%, whereas burrow counts overestimated numbers by 46%. These values were similar for both sexes, and on both spring and neap tides. Burrow counts and visual counts estimated absolute numbers of U. annulipes with equal consistency. At Mida Creek (Kenya) visual counts underestimated U. annulipes numbers by 37%, again with no differences between spring and neap tides. In Zanzibar 81% of N. meinerti burrows contained a crab. The instant visual count underestimated N. meinerti numbers by 41%, the continuous count, by 12%. Visual counts of S. guttatum in Zanzibar (Tanzania) underestimated crab numbers by 49%.

AB  - Chimneys are mud mounds built by fiddler crabs that encircle the entrance to their burrow. Their function in many species is unknown. In Uca capricornis, crabs of both sexes and all sizes build chimneys, but females do so disproportionately more often. There are no differences in the immediate physical or social environments between crabs with and without a chimney. Chimney owners spend less time feeding and more time underground than non-owners. We show experimentally that burrows with a chimney are less likely to be located by an intruder. It is possible that some crabs construct chimneys around their burrow to conceal the entrance and reduce the risk of losing it to an intruder.

AB  - In many species, females mate with multiple males, suggesting that polyandry confers fitness-enhancing benefits. The benefits of polyandry are usually attributed to either the cumulative acquisition of direct material benefits from consecutive mates or genetic benefits resulting from access to greater sperm diversity that facilitates cryptic female choice and sperm competition or simply elevates genetic diversity among offspring. With the notable exception of studies in birds that contrast within-pair and extrapair copulations, the alternative explanation that females receive different benefits from different types of mates is rarely explored. In the fiddler crab Uca mjoebergi, females mate multiply using two distinct mating tactics: surface and burrow mating. We found that females gained a different benefit from each type of mating. Females that initially mated on the mudflat surface secured the help of their mate in burrow defence. Male neighbours were significantly more likely to help after mating. In contrast, a female's final mating allowed her to choose the mate that would sire most of her offspring and gain access to a burrow that she then used for breeding. Together, these benefits provide a strong incentive for females to mate multiply. (C) 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Nutrient cycles in coastal marine sediments respond to a variety of factors such as the source and quality of organic matter, the effects of anaerobic remineralization (particularly sulfate reduction), and the activities of macroorganisms that ultimately affect redox conditions. In the majority of salt marshes along the east coast of the U.S., the mud fiddler crab, Uca pugnax, is the predominant macrofauna, while Spartina alterniflora is the predominant macrophyte. Sulfate-reduction rates and counts of sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) were profiled in the top 10 cm depth of sediments using a stratified random sampling design over an entire marsh basin that was mapped using GIS techniques. Tall Spartina (TS) and Creek Bank (CB) marsh zones were studied during summer and winter seasons, while the Short Spartina (SS) zone was studied only during summer. Depth-integrated sulfate-reduction rates (SRR) were highest during summer in TS regions of the marsh (46-77 mmol m-2 d-1), during the macrophytes' active growth state. Increased macrofaunal bioturbation decreased SRR temporally and spatially, therefore, those sites with more plants and fewer burrows had the highest rates. SS had the lowest summer SRR (26-31 mmol m-2 d-1), while the TS sites showed the lowest winter SRR. Nonbioturbated, unvegetated sites had the highest SRR during winter (0.32-1.86 mmol m-2 d-1). A most probable number (MPN) method determined SRB abundance as highest in nonbioturbated sites during summer, and the presence of Spartina further increased abundances (up to 2.4X1011 cells ml-1). Winter MPNs showed few differences between sites with counts averaging 106 cells ml-1. Both SRB activity and abundance were affected by seasonal changes in Spartina biomass and Uca bioturbation acting in concert. The data presented here indicate that SRB communities in coastal marine sediments are primarily controlled by the concentration and delivery of substrates (electron donors and acceptors). Currently, the effects of macroorganisms on SRB community composition are being elucidated using molecular techniques.

AB  - Fiddler crabs (Uca Spp.) are common inhabitants of temperate and tropical coastal communities throughout the world, often occupying specific microenvironments within mangrove and salt marsh habitats. As second intermediate hosts for trematodes, we investigated patterns of host distribution and parasitism for 3 species of sympatric fiddler crabs in mangrove habitats adjacent to the Indian River Lagoon, Florida. Fiddler crab distribution varied among species, with Uca speciosa dominating the low and mid intertidal regions of mangrove banks. This species also exhibited higher prevalence and abundance of Probolocoryphe lanceolata metacercariae compared with Uca rapax, which is relatively more abundant in the high intertidal zone. We conducted a field experiment to test whether U. speciosa was more heavily parasitized by P. lanceolata as a result of its habitat distribution by raising U. speciosa and U. rapax under identical environmental conditions. After exposure to shedding cercariae under the same field conditions, all individuals of U. speciosa became parasitized by P. lanceolata, whereas no U. rapax were parasitized, suggesting that differences in parasitism were driven by host selection.

AB  - Positive plant-animal interactions are important in community ecology, but relatively little attention has been paid to their effect on the production of mangroves, dominant halophytic trees in tropical coastal marshes. Here, the role of fiddler crab (Uca spp.) burrowing on the growth and production of the white mangrove, Laguncularia racemosa (< 2 years old), was examined in a restored marsh in Tampa Bay, Florida (27A degrees 41.65 N, 82A degrees 30.34 W) with manipulative experiments from June 2006 to May 2007. Fiddler crab burrowing significantly increased mangrove height by 27%, trunk diameter by 25%, and leaf production by 15%, compared to mangroves in crab exclusion enclosures. Additionally, the exclusion of fiddler crabs significantly increased interstitial water salinity from 32.4 to 44.2, and decreased the oxidation-reduction potential of the low organic sediments, but did not affect soil pH or sulfide concentration. Mangrove height, trunk diameter, and leaf production along a transect that varied in crab burrow density were positively associated with the number of crab burrows. Further, the density of sympatric Spartina alterniflora shoots was positively correlated with crab burrow density along the transect. As in temperate marshes, fiddler crabs can have significant ecological effects on mangrove communities, serving as ecological engineers by modulating the amount of resources available to marsh plants, and by altering the physical, chemical, and biological state of these soft sediment communities. In restored coastal systems that typically have very poor sediment quality, techniques such as soil amendment could be used to facilitate a more natural interaction between crabs and mangroves in ecosystem development.

AB  - The effects of bioturbation by the mud fiddler crab (Uca pugnax) on salt marsh seedling recruitment were investigated experimentally in this study. Burrowing and foraging activity caused a large amount of soil disturbance, which in turn negatively impacted the establishment of seedlings. Either seeds did not germinate or seedlings were uprooted or buried. Although the majority of the published literature suggests a positive influence of Uca spp. on salt marsh plant growth, at high densities they have the potential to hinder the re-colonization of areas made bare by previous disturbance. This study illustrates the perhaps underappreciated role that bioturbators can have on vegetation patterns in salt marshes and other ecosystems.

AB  - Given the great range of visual systems, tasks and habitats, there is surprisingly little experimental evidence of how visual limitations affect behavioural strategies under natural conditions. Analysing this relationship will require an experimental system that allows for the synchronous measurement of visual cues and visually guided behaviour. The first step in quantifying visual cues from an animal's perspective is to understand the filter properties of its visual system. We examined the first stage of visual processing - sampling by the ommatidial array - in the compound eye of the fiddler crab Uca vomeris. Using an in vivo pseudopupil method we determined sizes and viewing directions of ommatidia and created a complete eye map of optical and sampling resolution across the visual field. Our results reveal five distinct eye regions (ventral, dorsal, frontal, lateral and medial) which exhibit clear differences in the organisation of the local sampling array, in particular with respect to the balance of resolution and contrast sensitivity. We argue that, under global eye space constraints, these regional optimisations reflect the information content and behavioural relevance of the corresponding parts of the visual field. In demonstrating the tight link between visual sampling, visual cues and behavioural strategies, our analysis highlights how the study of natural behaviour and natural stimuli is essential to our understanding and interpretation of the evolution and ecology of animal behaviour and the design of sensory systems.

AB  - Predator avoidance behaviour costs time, energy and opportunities, and prey animals need to balance these costs with the risk of predation. The decisions necessary to strike this balance are often based on information that is inherently imperfect and incomplete because of the limited sensory capabilities of prey animals. Our knowledge, however, about how prey animals solve the challenging task of restricting their responses to the most dangerous stimuli in their environment is very limited. Using dummy predators, we examined the contribution of visual flicker to the predator avoidance response of the fiddler crab Uca vomeris. The results illustrate that crabs let purely black or purely white dummies approach significantly closer than black-and-white flickering dummies. We show that this effect complements other factors that modulate escape timing such as retinal speed and the crab's distance to its burrow, and is therefore not due exclusively to an earlier detection of the flickering signal. By combining and adjusting a range of imperfect response criteria in a way that relates to actual threats in their natural environment, prey animals may be able to measure risk and adjust their responses more efficiently, even under difficult or noisy sensory conditions.

AB  - To efficiently provide an animal with relevant information, the design of its visual system should reflect the distribution of natural signals and the animal's tasks. In many behavioural contexts, however, we know comparatively little about the moment-to-moment information-processing challenges animals face in their daily lives. In predator avoidance, for instance, we lack an accurate description of the natural signal stream and its value for risk assessment throughout the prey's defensive behaviour. We characterized the visual signals generated by real, potentially predatory events by video-recording bird approaches towards an Uca vomeris colony. Using four synchronized cameras allowed us to simultaneously monitor predator avoidance responses of crabs. We reconstructed the signals generated by dangerous and non-dangerous flying animals, identified the cues that triggered escape responses and compared them with those triggering responses to dummy predators. Fiddler crabs responded to a combination of multiple visual cues (including retinal speed, elevation and visual flicker) that reflect the visual signatures of distinct bird and insect behaviours. This allowed crabs to discriminate between dangerous and non-dangerous events. The results demonstrate the importance of measuring natural sensory signatures of biologically relevant events in order to understand biological information processing and its effects on behavioural organization.

AB  - This paper records investigations made on the ecology of intertidal crabs of the Brisbane River.

Traverses were made at selected localities extending from the river mouth upstream to points beyond the limit of tidal influence. Twenty-three species of crabs were found, two of which extend 37 miles upstream. The population was found to fall into four clearly defined vertical zones: (1) sesarmine zone, H.W.N. upwards, (2) ooypodine zone, H.W.K. to M.S.L., (3) upper macrophthalmine zone, M.S.L. to L.W.X., and (4) lower macrophthalmine zone, L.W.N. to L.W.S.

After drought, species not usually found in the river were present in the lower reaches. Freshwater flooding caused disappearance of these from the river and reduced the upstream penetration of one species.

Comparisons with work in other parts of the world show that the estuarine crab distribution in the Brisbane River is similar to that in South Africa and Java. It is suggested that salinity is the most important factor controlling the distribution of estuarine crabs.

AB  - Population structure and life history of Uca uruguayensis have been studied for the first time at the southern limit of its geographic range (Mar Chiquita Lagoon, Buenos Aires Province, Argentina). This population lives in homogeneous intertidal muddy habitat and has a bimodal size frequency distribution during most of the year. Crabs are recruited in fall, grow slowly during winter and fast through spring. In the first summer females are ovigerous for the first time (carapace width less than 9 mm). Adults remain alive and reproductively active until the end of the second summer (reaching more than 14 mm carapace width). The lifespan, including larval stages, lasts two years. The adult population averages 65% males; sex ratio increases with size, from 50 to 90% approximately. The proportion of males having the right or left chaela hypertrophied did not differ significantly from an expected 1:1 ratio. Juveniles and small males from 3 to 5 mm carapace width, frequently showed the lost of the right or left chaela, but indistinctly.

AB  - Staszak, L.A. and Armitage, A.R., 2013. Evaluating salt marsh restoration success with an index of ecosystem integrity. Journal of Coastal Research, 29(2), 410-418. Coconut Creek (Florida), ISSN 0749-0208. In concept, ecological restoration will improve ecosystem characteristics of degraded habitats, but in practice, restoration success assessments typically target vegetation communities. We sought to determine if estuarine emergent marsh restoration projects (Galveston Bay, Texas) that had successfully achieved permit-mandated plant coverage were comparable to reference sites at an ecosystem level. We used a Rapid Assessment Method developed specifically for this habitat (Galv-RAM) to compare restored (ages 5-15 y) and reference marshes. Thirteen biotic and abiotic characteristics were used to calculate an ecosystem index score, whereby a pristine habitat would score 100%. The average Galv-RAM ecosystem index score for reference marshes (81%) was typical for urbanized estuaries. Restored marshes scored 75%, indicating that they were relatively well developed, although there was substantial variability in ecosystem index scores among sites. Discriminant function analysis revealed that reference sites had more benthic epifauna (periwinkles, fiddler crabs); epifauna were virtually absent from restored sites. Overall, Galv-RAM scores did not vary with restored marsh age, but some individual features changed over time: older restored sites tended to have higher plant diversity and belowground plant biomass than younger restored sites. The ultimate goal of coastal wetland restoration is to improve the integrity of the regional wetland landscape by augmenting many different ecosystem functions. Therefore, although not all measured variables scored optimally in all restored sites, each of the sites had relatively high ecological value and contributed to the integrity of a larger scale matrix of wetland habitat.

AB  - In this paper we describe results of a study designed to test the hypothesis that coastal regions with weak subtidal flow (i.e., coastal null zones) may serve as retention areas for estuarine larval forms. Our investigation assessed the distribution of 3 taxa of crab larvae (Callinectes sapidus, Uca spp., and Hexapanopeus angustifrons) within a 200-km(2) region encompassing the mouth of Delaware Bay (ca. 39 degrees N, 75 degrees W). Previous studies had shown that larvae of C. sapidus and Uca spp. are exported to the coastal ocean, while larvae of H. angustifrons are retained within the estuary. In the present investigation, we conducted simultaneous plankton tows at 3 stations during peak spawning season. Samples were collected from a depth of 1 m every 30 min throughout a complete tidal cycle. One station was located 15 km within the bay and was subjected to strong flow at tidal frequency. A second station was located within a southward-flowing coastal current near the southern terminus of the bay at Cape Henlopen. A final station was located in a coastal area of weak subtidal flow near Cape May at the northern terminus of the bay. Results provide a unique synoptic view of larval distributions in 3 distinct hydrographic regimes in the mouth of a major estuary. The coastal-current station was characterized by low concentrations of newly hatched C. sapidus and Uca zoeae, while the null-zone station had high densities of both early and advanced larval stages of these two taxa. In contrast, the station located within the bay had few C. sapidus or Uca zoeae and was dominated by both early and advanced stages of the mud crab H. angustifrons. These data provide clear evidence for the retention of exported larval forms in a coastal null zone associated with the circulation of a large estuary and thus are consistent with our hypothesis.

AB  - Species that change colour present an ideal opportunity to study the control and tuning of camouflage with regards to the background. However, most research on colour-pattern change and camouflage has been undertaken with species that rapidly alter appearance (in seconds), despite the fact that most species change appearance over longer time periods (e.g. minutes, hours, or days). We investigated whether individuals of the horned ghost crab (Ocypode ceratophthalmus) from Singapore can change colour, when this occurs, and how it influences camouflage. Individuals showed a clear daily rhythm of colour change, becoming lighter during the day and darker at night, and this significantly improved their camouflage to the sand substrate upon which they live. Individuals did not change colour when put into dark conditions, but they did become brighter when placed on a white versus a black substrate. Our findings show that ghost crabs have a circadian rhythm of colour change mediating camouflage, which is fine-tuned by adaptation to the background brightness. These types of colour change can enable individuals to achieve effective camouflage under a range of environmental conditions, substrates, and time periods, and may be widespread in other species.(c) 2013 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2013, 109, 257270.

AB  - Gull-billed Terns Gelochelidon nilotica wintering in Guinea Bissau mainly fed on fiddler crabs Uca tangeri and were occasionally seen feeding on fish and locusts. As fiddler crabs have a low energy content, terns need a large gross intake to meet daily energy demands. Fiddler crabs also have a low ratio of digestible flesh to exoskeleton, and therefore tern food intake may be limited by gut capacity. Activity budgets of Gull-billed Terns feeding on fiddler crabs showed that a considerable part of the time was spent resting. The duration of resting intervals increased with energy intake and was positively correlated with the metabolisable energy content of the crab eaten, suggesting that resting periods were required for a proper digestion. The poor quality of fiddler crabs was offset by high capture rates. So daily energy expenditure of the terns could easily be met by feeding on fiddler crabs. Even when resting pauses were included in foraging time, foraging for only 1.5 hours on fiddler crabs satisfied the terns' daily energy demands. Instead, feeding on energy-rich fish would require about 2.5 hours to satisfy daily energy demands. Compared to the more specialised piscivorous Little Tern Sternula albifrons and Sandwich Tern Sterna sandvicensis, capture rate of fish was poor in Gull-billed Terns. From an energetic point of view, wintering Gull-billed Terns feeding on fiddler crabs seem to have an easy living in Guinea Bissau.

AB  - Intertidal organisms may employ circatidal rhythms to track the tidal cycle, but tidal patterns may vary within a species' range and necessitate adaptation to the local tides. Circatidal rhythms were examined in populations of the eastern Pacific fiddler crab Uca princeps (Smith) from four sites with differing tidal characteristics, La Paz (24degrees10'N; 110degrees21'W), San Blas (21degrees33'N; 105degrees18'W) and Manzanillo (19degrees6'N; 104degrees24'W), Mexico (lower amplitude, mixed semidiurnal tides) and Mata de Limon, Costa Rica (9degrees55'N; 84degrees43'W) (high-amplitude, semidiurnal tides). Local tides were characterized by harmonic constants of M-2, S-2, K-1, and O-1, partial tides that largely determine their semidiurnal and diurnal features. Rhythmic structure in continuously recorded locomotor activity of individual crabs held under laboratory conditions was described by cosinor and periodogram methods of time-series analysis. Both daily and circatidal rhythms were found in crabs studied in light-dark cycles set to local conditions at the time of collection. Crabs at all four sites shared a tendency toward bimodality, with a mid-morning activity peak and varying degrees of nocturnal activity. Circatidal rhythms closely matching the period of the 12.42-h M-2 partial tide were consistently present at all sites except Manzanillo. At Mata de Limon, the circatidal rhythm clearly dominated locomotor activity, but was strongly modulated by a daily rhythm in a repeating pattern at a semilunar interval. In contrast, the amplitude of the daily rhythm was higher than that of the circatidal rhythm in crabs from the three mixed tide sites on the Mexican coast, where the tidal pattern is dominated by a diurnal inequality arising from the diurnal K, and O-1 partial tides. These results suggest that populations of U. princeps use both daily and circatidal timing systems to track local forms of the tide generated by their M-2, S-2, K-1, and O-1 geophysical counterparts.

AB  - Coastal and estuarine organisms face increasing multiple challenges unique to their environment which include natural and anthropogenic stressors that threaten their physiology, fitness, and population persistence. Synthetic pyrethroid and insect growth regulator pesticide use for agriculture, urban and municipal pest control are of increasing concern in coastal areas as other pesticide groups come under strict regulations and that they possess the potential to significantly impact aquatic resources. My research focuses on how current insecticide release in or near coastal marsh environments alter the physiology, limb regeneration and molting ability of a crustacean indicator species, Uca pugnax , in the intertidal and coastal waters of the eastern United States. Little is known about whether low concentrations of pesticide residues in water and sediment enact consequences on crustacean physiological, development and growth processes. A runoff event simulation with permethrin contaminated sediment found that U. pugnax experienced induction of hepatopancreas glutathione S-transferase activity while respiration and hemolymph osmolarity did not vary. This detoxification enzyme holds promise as a generalist biomarker with other lines of evidence for pyrethroid contaminated marine sediments. In addition, Uca pugnax limb regeneration and molting processes following exposure to insect growth regulators or multiple stressors can be used to predict risks to population sustainability of commercially important and increasingly threatened estuarine crustacean populations. Following molt, male crabs displayed decreased body condition due to sexual dimorphic traits, mainly larger body size and disproportionate cheliped. Chronic methoprene exposure at environmental concentrations caused increased male abnormal regenerative limbs and delays in proecdysis. Both male and female crabs displayed increased variability in water-soluble exoskeleton protein possibly affecting exoskeleton quality. Lastly, using a central composite design, male and female crabs were evaluated for non-additive effects of these two pesticide stressors under different salinity regimes on molting processes. Permethrin induced mortality during proecdysis and caused increased growth in male crab regenerative limb growth. In addition, males displayed methoprene and permethrin non-additive effects on total exoskeleton protein content, reduced body mass gain, reduced carapace width gain and overall body condition loss. Females displayed resilience by only experiencing reduced carapace size gain and increased respiration rate, possibly due to increased metabolic and biotransformation of both pesticides. Overall, inputs of insect growth regulators, pyrethroid insecticides or their mixture into coastal wetland environments pose a risk to crustacean physiology, fitness and sensitive growth processes.

AB  - In coastal areas, the application of pyrethroid insecticides and the resulting sediment residues pose a potential threat to marine benthic ecosystems. Pyrethroids cause acute toxicity and exhibit a wide range of sublethal effects on fish and crustaceans when exposure is aqueous. Fiddler crabs that inhabit salt marsh sediment are sensitive to sediment-associated pollutants and serve as a sentinel species for xenobiotic exposure. We exposed adult U. pugnax to salt marsh sediment spiked with different 60% trans/40% cis permethrin concentrations for 96 h, and evaluated changes in oxygen consumption rate, hemolymph osmolarity, and glutathione S-transferase activity (GST) following exposure. Marsh sediment was not lethal to U. pugnax at permethrin concentrations of 100-10,000 mu g/kg. Sediment-bound permethrin had no significant effect on respiration and osmoregulation. Exposure caused an induction of hepatopancreas GST in a dose-dependent manner. Gill and midgut tissues showed induction at permethrin concentrations at 10,000 mu g/kg. We conclude that short term exposure to permethrin-contaminated sediment does not pose a significant threat to this species or impact respiration and osmoregulation. Furthermore, increased GST activity allows us to evaluate this enzyme's induction as a generalist biomarker for sediment-bound pyrethroid exposures. (C) 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Insect growth regulator application for wetland mosquito control remains controversial due to the potential for disruption of normal development and growth processes in non-target crustaceans and beneficial arthropods, e.g. Apis mellifera. Concerns include slow-release methoprene formulations and its environmental breakdown products which minuc an endogenous crustacean hormone and retinoids, respectively. Our primary objective was to evaluate the effect that a chronic methoprene exposure would have on male and female Uca pugnax limb regeneration and molting. After single limb autonomy, limb growth and molt stage were monitored every two days while eyestalk ablation was used to induce proecdysis. Dorsal carapace was collected 6 days post-molt to determine protein and chitin content. In post-molt crabs, methoprene-exposed individuals displayed lower percent gain in body weight. Male crabs lost more weight per body volume than females, took significantly longer to proceed through proecdysis than females exposed to 0.1 mu g/L methoprene and exhibited significantly elevated frequency for abnormal limb formation at 1.0 mu g/L while females displayed no such trend. Methoprene did not significantly alter extractable exoskeleton protein or chitin content. However, variable water-soluble protein expression increased with exposure at 1.0 mu g/L (1 ppb) which contributed to overall variability in total protein content. Our findings suggest that adult male U. pugnax possess greater sensitivity to chronic methoprene exposure during limb regeneration and molting, potentially affecting their post-molt fitness. Furthennore, methoprene has the potential to impact post-molt biomass and exocuticle quality. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Exposure to multiple stressors from natural and anthropogenic sources poses risk to sensitive crustacean growth and developmental processes. Applications of synthetic pyrethroids and insect growth regulators near shallow coastal waters may result in harmful mixture effects depending on the salinity regime. The potential for nonadditive effects of a permethrin (0.01-2 mu g/L), methoprene (0.03-10 mu g/L), and salinity (10-40 ppt) exposure on male and female Uca pugnax limb regeneration and molting processes was evaluated by employing a central composite rotatable design with multifactorial regression. Crabs underwent single-limb autotomy followed by a molting challenge under 1 of 16 different mixture treatments. During the exposure (21-66 d), individual limb growth, major molt stage duration, abnormal limb regeneration, and respiration were monitored. At 6 d postmolt, changes in body mass, carapace width, and body condition factor were evaluated. Dorsal carapace tissue was collected, and protein and chitin were extracted to determine the composition of newly synthesized exoskeleton. The present results suggest chronic, low-dose exposures to multiple pesticide stressors cause less-than-additive effects on U. pugnax growth processes. Under increasing concentrations of methoprene and permethrin, males had more protein in their exoskeletons and less gain in body mass, carapace width, and body condition compared to females. Females exhibited less gain in carapace width than controls in response to methoprene and permethrin. Females also displayed elevated respiration rates at all stages of molt, suggesting a high metabolic rate. Divergent growth and fitness between the sexes over the long term could influence crustacean population resilience.

AB  - The current phylogenetic hypothesis for the evolution and biogeography of fiddler crabs relies on the assumption that complex behavioral traits are assumed to also be evolutionary derived, Indo-west Pacific fiddler crabs have simpler reproductive social behavior and are more marine and were thought to be ancestral to the more behaviorally complex and more terrestrial American species, It was also hypothesized that the evolution of more complex social and reproductive behavior was associated with the colonization of the higher intertidal zones, Our phylogenetic analysis, based upon a set of independent molecular characters, however, demonstrates how widely entrenched ideas about evolution and biogeography led to a reasonable, but apparently incorrect, conclusion about the evolutionary trends within this pantropical group of crustaceans, Species bearing the set of ''derived traits'' are phylogenetically ancestral, suggesting an alternative evolutionary scenario: the evolution of reproductive behavioral complexity in fiddler crabs may have arisen multiple times during their evolution, The evolution of behavioral complexity may have arisen by coopting of a series of other adaptations for high intertidal living and antipredator escape. A calibration of rates of molecular evolution from populations on either side of the Isthmus of Panama suggest a sequence divergence rate for 16S rRNA of 0.9% per million years, The divergence between the ancestral clade and derived forms is estimated to be approximate to 22 million years ago, whereas the divergence between the American and Indo-west Pacific is estimated to be approximate to 17 million years ago.

AB  - Species composition and fluctuations of abundance of macroinvertebrates of 2 Juncus tidal marshes of N Florida [USA] were studied during 1973. Both the marshes were subdivided into low, upper and high marsh zones based on the soil characteristics. In the low and upper marsh zones, random samples of epifauna were taken monthly with 1 m2 traps, and infauna from 10 cm deep and 0.0625 m2 samples of soil. Samples were also obtained along 2 transects, including high marsh, at each locality to study the horizontal zonation of species in the 3 soil types. Tidal creeks were sampled monthly with a seine at low and high tides. Water temperature, salinity and dissolved oxygen were measured. A total of 51 spp. were encountered and marsh zones exhibited distinct species assemblages. Based on biological index (BI) values, the lower and upper marsh were Littorina-Cyathura-tanaidacean communities with an abundance of 3 polychaetes, Scoloplos fragilis, Neanthes succinea and Laeonereis culveri. High marsh zones were characterized by an abundance of Uca spp., Melampus bidentatus nd Cerithidea scalariformis. Data from 1 m2 areas along the 2 transects revealed a distinct horizontal zonation of species distribution. The mean density of marsh invertebrates in trap samples was 475/m2 and average densities were significantly higher in low marsh (540/m2) than in the upper marsh (381/m2). Peaks of abundance were observed in winter and fall. Mean biomass for the year was 123g m2. Species diversity (H') was significantly different among seasons, with peaks in spring and fall. Species richness (D) and equitability (E) closely followed the seasonal trends of H'. Mean homogeneity (HI) of species occurrence was 33% between the low and upper marsh zones. Some species showed distinct seasonal succession. Based on length frequency data, some species were found to breed in the fall and winter.

AB  - To evaluate the impact on fauna of the release of toxic waste from the tailings dam operated by the Boliden Apirsa S.L company at Aznalcollar, Seville (Spain) a study was carried out of total and inorganic arsenic contents in 164 samples from six different estuary species, including molluscs, crustaceans and fish, collected at six sampling stations distributed along the estuary and mouth of the River Guadalquivir. The contents found, expressed in micrograms per gram wet weight, were as follows. Total arsenic: Crassostrea angulata - giant cupped oyster (2.44 +/- 0.45); Scrobicularia plana - peppery furrow (2.50 +/- 0.73); Palaemon longirostris - delta prawn (1.33 +/- 0.54); Uca tangeri - AfroEuropean fiddler crab (1.76 +/- 0.08); Melicertus kerathurus - shrimp (3.60 +/- 1.92); and Liza ramada - mullet (0.65 +/- 0.38). Inorganic arsenic: C. angulata (0.09 +/- 0.02); S. plana (0.38 +/- 0.23); P. longirostris (0.04 +/- 0.01); U. tangeri (0.22 +/- 0.03); M. kerathurus (0.03 +/- 0.01); and L. ramada (0.03 +/- 0.03). The levels of total As are comparable to those obtained by other authors. With respect to inorganic arsenic, only S. plana and U. tangeri present high levels of inorganic arsenic. This may be due to the fact that these organisms live in estuary sediments, reservoirs of inorganic arsenic, and ingest particles of sediments during feeding. Because of the lack of information for this area concerning previous levels of total and inorganic arsenic in the species analysed, it was not possible to establish the impact on the fauna of the River Guadalquivir estuary of the toxic spill resulting from the failure of the mine tailings dam at Aznalcollar. With respect to the implications to human health as a result of consumption of species from the Guadalquivir estuary, only with the species Scrobicularia plana, as a high consumption of this mollusc might, in some cases, exceed the maximum tolerable intake for inorganic arsenic indicated by the FAO/WHO. Consumption of the liver of L. ramada does not appear to present problems to human health. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - 1. Nine populations of seven species of fiddler crabs, genus Uca from Peninsular Malaysia and Sarawak were analysed for genetic variation of 10 enzymatic and non-enzymatic proteins comprising 13 loci.

2. The average heterozygosities were similar to those reported for fiddler crabs of the American subgenera.

3. The mean genetic identity for four species of the subgenus Deltuca was greater than that between two species of the subgenus Celuca.

4. Celuca showed distinctive genetic differences from the other subgenus (Deltuca and Thalassuca) in the Indo-West Pacific, suggesting an earlier divergence between these groups. Celuca evolved a conspicuous (lateral straight or circular lifting) waving gesture independently of Deltuca and Thalassuca with less conspicuous (vertical and semi-unflexed) waving displays.

AB  - The macrobenthic fauna of all types of intertidal area of the Surinam coast, mainly mud flats, were briefly studied by coring. Crustaceans dominated; polychaetes and mollusks were poorly represented. The highest biomass values (32-37 g.cntdot.m-2 ADW [ash-free dry weight], mainly contributed by Uca maracoani) were found around high tide level, at the border of the mangrove forest. Just outside the Uca zone, on sheltered places also high values (.apprx. 20 g.cntdot.m-2 ADW, mainly contributed by Tanaidacea) were found. In the middle and lower parts of the flats biomass was low (only a few g.cntdot.m-2 or less), probably a result of the instability of the sediment. The following crustaceans not recorded previously for Surinam were found living in the intertidal clay and mud: Hexapanopeus schmitti, Cycloplax pinnotheroides, Pinnixa sayana (Brachyura) and Upogebia brasiliensis (Macrura).

AB  - I investigated mass wandering by the fiddler crab Uca perplexa on Okinawa Island, Japan. Many larger males wandered during the daytime low tide for four continuous days in their reproductive season. Just after exposure of their burrows they moved uphill, then returned to the burrow area before dead low tide without feeding. During the wandering phase, the males did not wave to females to initiate mating. Males resumed waving after the wandering phase. I discuss why the large males wander en masse in relation to the crabs' mating system and larval release.

AB  - In the reproductive season, mature females of the Fiddler crab Uca perplexa leave their burrows and wander about their habitat for mating. To clarify whether the fiddler crabs respond to colour or luminosity, I examined the behavioural responses of the males to the wandering females before and after the fernales were painted white, red, black or blue. The behaviours of the males were categorized into three types: lateral-circular wave and lateral-straight wave for courting, and repelling. Before painting, almost all of the males courted the females. After painting, significantly fewer males courted the red-, black- and blue-painted females than courted the white-painted females. These results mean that the Fiddler crabs can discriminate colours or luminosity. The role of body colour as a visual signal in crab society is discussed. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Interaction and habitat partition between the soldier crab Mictyris brevidactylus (prey) and the fiddler crab Uca perplexa (predator) were examined at a sandy tidal flat on Okinawa Island, Japan, where they co-occur. Both live in dense colonies. When the soldier crabs were released in the densely populated habitat of the fiddler crab, male fiddler crabs, which maintain permanent burrows in hard sediment, preyed on small soldier crabs and repelled large ones. Thus, the fiddler crabs prevented the soldier crabs from trespassing. It was also observed whether soldier crabs burrowed successfully when they were released 1) where soldier crab burrows just under the sand were abundant, 2) in a transition area between the two species, 3) an area without either species, and 4) where artificial tunnels simulated soldier crabs' feeding tunnels were made by piling up sand in the area lacking either species. In contrast to the non-habitat area, many soldier crabs burrowed in the sediment near the release point in the tunnel, transition and artificial tunnel areas. This indicates that the feeding tunnels on the surface attracted other crabs after emergence. When the large male fiddler crabs were transplanted into the artificial burrows made in soft sediment of the soldier crab habitat, all left their artificial burrows by 2 days. In the fiddler crab habitat, however, about one-third of the transplanted male fiddler crabs remained in the artificial burrows after 3 days. The soldier crabs regularly disturb the sediment by the up and down movement of their burrow (small air chamber) between tides. This disturbance probably prevents the fiddler crab from making and occupying permanent burrows. Thus, it appears that these crabs divide the sandy intertidal zone by sediment hardness and exclude each other by different means. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Variation of the branchial formula of 18 species of crabs collected from littoral and supralittoral regions on Phuket Island, Thailand, was examined in relation to the semiterrestrial environment. All species inhabiting water-logged substrata (3 species of Macrophthalmus, 3 species of Metaplax, and Chiromantes dussumieri) had an identical branchial formula consisting of 8 pairs of well-developed branchiae. In contrast, crabs inhabiting well-drained substrata had respiratory organs other than branchiae (6 species of Uca with well-developed inner linings of the branchiostegites, forming lungs, and Ilyoplax delsmani, I. gangerica, Dotillopsis brevirarsis, and Dotilla myctiroides with ''tympana'' on the meral segments of the thoracic pereiopods). The branchiae were more reduced and/or absent in the species occupying higher ground. In general, the major branchiae except the podobranchiae were divided into 3 types by histological observation: the highly osmoregulatory branchiae, the weakly osmoregulatory branchiae, and the respiratory branchiae. The species inhabiting well-drained substrata, especially species of the genus Uca with fewer branchiae, had more highly osmoregulatory branchiae than the species inhabiting water-logged substrata, even when they lived at almost the same tidal level. The reduction and/or disappearance of branchiae in the species inhabiting well-drained substrata is discussed in relation to the morphology of branchiae, the development of respiratory organs (lungs and tympana), and semiterrestrial environments.

AB  - The fiddler crab Uca panamensis (Stimpson, 1959) inhabits rocky shores. We examined its preference for feeding substratum-sand or rock-and its manner of feeding. The crab made its burrow in the sand among rocks but preferred to feed on rocks. The feeding time decreased as the distance between the burrow and the rock increased. We consider this to be a result of exclusive interaction among the crabs because they defended their feeding area on the rocks against others. The crab wetted a small area of rock with water held in the branchial chambers before and during feeding. It pinched up the wetted surface in the minor chelipeds, which have bundles of setae on the posterior tips of the dactyl and pollex, and put the material into its buccal cavity. It never expelled sand pellets while feeding on rock, which indicates that it swallowed the food particles directly, without sorting. The bundles of setae retained water by capillary attraction, which suggests that they capture the suspended fine food particles scraped from the rock. The wetting action may prevent the fine materials from dispersing. We consider that morphological alteration of the minor chelipeds, the application of water from the branchial chambers, and direct swallowing permit the fiddler crab to feed on fine materials attached to rocks.

AB  - The soldier crab Mictyris brevidactylus Stimpson inhabits sandy flats of Southeast Asia. The crabs that we studied fed oil deposited matter in the surface sand in two ways. Oil well-drained sand in the upper part of their habitat, they usually made a single tunnel roofed with sand to conceal themselves while they led. After feeding, they returned to all ascending shaft from which they had earlier emerged. Then, they descended via the plugged ascending shaft and transformed the shape of the shaft into an ovoid air chamber at a sufficient depth. During the daytime low tide, on the waterlogged, fluid sand near the shoreline, large individuals, mostly males, fed in droves on the surface while moving along the shoreline as it moved with the tide. After feeding for about 2 h, they made a small air chamber slightly above the shoreline by using corkscrew-style digging, and descended into the semi-fluid sand. During the night-time low tide, the crabs fed separately for about 4 h oil both the fluid sand near the shoreline and the well-drained frill sand in the upper habitat, and retreated into the sand, although they took longer to retreat into the well-drained sand than into the semi-fluid sand. That is, the crabs feeding on the surface at the daytime low tide returned to the subsurface-feeding area and made a small air chamber during the night-time low tide. Later. at low tide, the small air chamber was elongated to allow subsurface feeding. We consider that the movement to the upper habitat at night-time and the feeding near the shoreline in the daytime help the crabs evade predators that rely on sight, such as birds.

AB  - Two species of fiddler crab, Uca tetragonon (Herbst, 1790) and Uca vocans (Linnaeus, 1758), which belong to the subgenus Gelasimus, dwell on rocky shores and muddy-sandy tidal flats, respectively, in Phuket Is., Thailand. We investigated their feeding ecology in relation to the morphology of their feeding organs: minor food-handling chelipeds and maxillipeds. U. tetragonon fed chiefly on rocks covered by filamentous green algae. U. vocans fed on the emerged sand and in shallow water along the shoreline and in pools. While feeding, both crabs made sand pellets beneath their mouthparts and discarded them, indicating that they divided the matter scooped up with their minor chelipeds into edible and inedible fractions by using the maxillipeds in the water passing through their buccal cavity. The morphology of maxillipeds hardly differed between the two species, which means that both species are flotation-feeders. The morphology of their minor chelipeds, however, differed: the tips of the dactyl and pollex were. at in U. tetragonon and pointed in U. vocans. When the minor cheliped was closed, U. tetragonon had a hemispherical space in the distal one-fourth of the gape, which was closed by the framing keratin layers and a few setae of the dactyl and pollex. On the other hand, U. vocans had an ellipsoidal space in the distal half of the gape. We consider these morphological characters to be adaptations to the different feeding substrates for retaining more food-laden sediment. We discuss the role of the setae on the minor chelipeds on the basis of the morphological differences between populations of U. tetragonon in Phuket Is. and East Africa where the crab inhabits muddy-sandy tidal flats.

AB  - Occurrences of rare species of fiddler crab, Uca arcuata (De Haan, 1833) and U. lactea (De Haan, 1835), are newly recorded from a tidal flat at the mouth of the Aono River, Izu Peninsula, Shizuoka Prefecture, Japan. Numbers of crabs and their sexes were recorded by viewing from a distance, and several of the crabs were collected for measuring their size. Observations and sampling were conducted 12 times from September, 1999, to August, 2002, at low spring tide. During this period, three individuals of U. arcuata were recorded, all males. Numerous individuals of U. lactea were found during the same period, and the maximum number recorded was 36 in September, 2000. Ages of the crabs were estimated from carapace size, based on earlier published population studies. The largest male U. arcuata on the Aono River flat was estimated to be two years old, and the other two males were one year old. Collected males of U. lactea ranged from 15.8 to 18.5 mm in carapace width, and females from 13.3 to 15.8 mm; the ages of these crabs were estimated as two years or more.

AB  - A 148 kDa protein which possibly participates in collagen metabolism was isolated from the adductor muscle of the abalone Haliotis discus, by a series of chromatographic procedures involving DEAE-Toyopearl 650 M ion exchange, TSK G3000SWG gel filtration, and Butyl-Toyopearl 650 M hydrophobic columns. Reactivity with collagen was measured as the ability to solubilize the film containing pepsin-solubilized collagen from the same animal. Active fractions of various purification steps solubilized the film at 37 degrees C within 60 min. The purified protein consisted of a single polypeptide chain and the molecular weight was estimated by SDS-PAGE to be 148,000. This protein did not contain methionine and half-cystine, and its N-terminal amino acid sequence differed from any sequences of known collagenases.

AB  - Up-estuary migration of crab larvae to adult habitats is thought to be accomplished by selective tidal transport in which late-stage larvae enter the water column on flood tides and remain on or near the bottom on ebb tides. This study measured endogenous rhythms in swimming by the last larval stage (megalopa) of blue crabs Callinectes sapidus and fiddler crabs Uca spp. Previous field studies found that megalopae of both species were only abundant in the estuarine water column on nocturnal rising tides. Megalopae were collected from the Newport River Estuary, North Carolina (34 degrees 41'N; 76 degrees 40'W) during August-September 1992 and swimming activity was recorded for 4.5 to 7 d under constant conditions with a video system. Rhythms exhibited by both genera in the laboratory were not identical to those recorded in the field. Uca spp. displayed a circatidal rhythm, with maximum swimming occurring near the time of high tide in the field. Rhythm amplitude increased when crushed oyster shells were present, which suggested that megalopae bury or cling to the substrate during quiescent periods. In contrast, C. sapidus had a circadian rhythm in which maximum swimming coincided with the day phase in the field. In most trials, the activity of blue crab megalopae was unrelated to the expected tidal cycle. It was concluded that a tidal rhythm in swimming was the behavioral basis of flood-tide transport for fiddler crab larvae. The endogenous rhythm in blue crabs does not participate in transport, which probably results from behavioral responses to environmental cues associated with flood tide.

AB  - The megalopal larval stage of many estuarine brachyuran crabs appears to return to adult habitats by undergoing rhythmic vertical migrations which result in saltatory up-estuary transport on flood tides. Larval ascent into the water column during rising tides may be cued by changing hydrologic variables. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the responses of field-caught megalopae of the blue crab Callinectes sapidus and the fiddler crab Uca spp. to constant rates of pressure and salinity change under laboratory conditions. For both genera, pressure changes resulted in increased movement (barokinesis) and upward migration in the test chamber, with C. sapidus megalopae having a lower response threshold (2.8x10(-2) mbar s(-1)) than Uca spp. larvae (5x10(-2) mbar s(-1)). Similarly, larvae ascended in response to increasing salinity, with C. sapidus larvae being more sensitive. Larvae were negatively phototactic and failed to respond to pressure increases at light levels above 1.0x10(15) and 1.0x10(13) photons m(-2) s(-1) for C. sapidus and Uca spp. megalopae, respectively. Such responses are thought to explain the low abundances of larvae in the water column during daytime flood tides. Nevertheless, threshold sensitivities to increasing pressure for both genera were above levels experienced during flood-tide conditions in the field. Similarly, it is unlikely that increasing salinity is sufficient to induce ascent in Uca spp. postlarvae. However, rates of salinity increase during mid-flood tide typically reach levels necessary to induce an ascent in C. sapidus megalopae. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that fiddler crab megalopae utilize an endogenous activity rhythm for flood-tide transport, while blue crab megalopae rely upon external cues, especially salinity changes, to time their sojourns in the water column.

AB  - Although U. salsisitus Oliveira, 1939, has been placed as a junior synonym of U. rapax (Smith, 1870), a possible synonymy with Uca vocator (Herbst, 1804) has never been discarded. The retrieval of one male paratype of U. salsisitus and its confrontation with U. rapax and U. vocator shed light on the synonymy of U. salsisitus. It is shown that the type series of Uca salsisitus actually includes two species: Oliveira's original description was based upon U. vocator (Herbst), while the illustrations he provided and the retrieved male paratype correspond to U. rapax (Smith).

AB  - Crustacean molting is known to be regulated largely by ecdysteroids and crustacean hyperglycemic hormone (CHH) neuropeptide family including molt-inhibiting hormone (MIH) and CHH. The surge of 20-OH ecdysone and/or ponasterone A initiates the molting process through binding to its conserved heterodimeric nuclear receptor: Ecdysone Receptor (EcR) and Ultraspiracle (USP)/Retinoid-X Receptor (RXR). To better understand the role of ecdysteroids in the molt regulation, the full-length cDNAs of the blue crab, Callinectes sapidus EcR1 and RXR1 were isolated from the Y-organs and their expression levels were determined in both Y-organs and eyestalks at various molt stages. Y-organs show the expression of four putative isoforms of CasEcRs and CasRXRs which differ in the length of the open reading frame but share the same domain structures as in typical nuclear receptors: AF1, DBD, HR, LBD, and AF2. The putative CasEcR isoforms are derived from a 27-aa insert in the HR and a 49-aa residue substitution in the LBD. In contrast, an insertion of a 5-aa and/or a 45-aa in the DBD and LBD gives rise to CasRXR isoforms. The eyestalks and Y-organs show the co-expression of CasEcRs and CasRXRs but at the different levels. In the eyestalks, the expression levels of CasRXRs are 3-5 times higher than those of CasEcRs, while in Y-organs, CasRXRs are 2.5-4 times higher than CasEcRs. A tissue-specific response to the changes in the levels of hemolymphatic ecdysteroids indicates that these tissues may have differences in the sensitivity or responsiveness to ecdysteroids. The presence of upstream open reading frame and internal ribosome entry site in 5' UTR sequences of C sapidus and other arthropod EcR/RXR/USP analyzed by in silico indicates a plausible, strong control(s) of the translation of these receptors.

AB  - We quantify the temporal variation in day and night habitat use by Wilson's Plovers (Charadrius wilsonia cinnamominus) in the Chacopata lagoon complex, in northeastern Venezuela, during the non-breeding season. The overall (day + night) time spent by plovers on foraging habitats did not vary seasonally. However, the duration of their presence on foraging sites during daylight was very short from November to January, but was compensated by an increase during nighttime. The day and night distribution of plovers over the lagoon complex differed substantially. Wilson's Plovers were gregarious and roosted most of the time during daylight. After dusk, they left their diurnal roosts and repositioned themselves solitarily throughout the lagoon mudflats, or flew to their nocturnal individual roosts close to mangroves. They foraged during low tides, but never during the entire low-tide periods, neither during daytime nor during nighttime. The plovers spent more time on foraging sites during the first part of the night than thereafter, and on moonlit nights, although they often occurred on feeding habitats during moonless nights. This appears to be correlated with the observation that Uca cumulanta, their main prey, is active during this portion of the night and on moonlit nights. The main reason why Wilson's Plovers are largely nocturnal appears to be the avoidance of diurnal predators.

AB  - In coastal lagoons of northeastern Venezuela, resident Wilson's Plovers (Charadrius wilsonia cinnamominus) forage almost entirely on fiddler crabs (Uca cumulanta). During the non-breeding season, particularly from November to January, plovers are seldom on foraging sites during daylight but forage more during nighttime. Objectives of this study were to document the availability of Uca cumulanta and to determine if night foraging by Wilson's Plovers in tropical areas is tied to abundance or activity of fiddler crabs. We used a time-lapse video camera to monitor the number of crabs outside burrows, both during nighttime and daytime. Results show that crab activity was almost exclusively diurnal. Although some crabs were active after sunset, particularly from May to August, diurnal activity of crabs was always 3-10X higher than nocturnal activity. Therefore, Wilson's Plovers feeding patterns are not exclusively a function of the period when their main prey is most active or abundant. Results best support our previous interpretation that nocturnal foraging in Wilson's Plover is a strategy for avoiding diurnal predators.

AB  - Two sites in Phillips Creek Marsh, located on the Eastern Shore of Virginia, were used to determine what effect fiddler crabs have on how nitrogen cycles within an Atlantic salt marsh. Data gathered by the author in previous studies (Thomas and Christian 2001, Thomas 2004) were used to construct two nitrogen cycles which represented the two study sites, one with and one without fiddler crabs. These cycles were analyzed using Network Analyses, a group of analyses that evaluates the structure of networks of ecosystems such as Finn Cycling Index and Ascendency, an emergent property. Even though the amount of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) entering each site was the same, the difference in how it cycled was dramatic. The largest differences involved plant roots and sediment organic nitrogen (SON). The percentage of the total amount of DIN input to each site that went to root production was 93% greater at the site without crabs than the site with crabs, and those roots then put 180% more of the inputted DIN into SON in the site without crabs than the site with crabs. However, the emergent properties of each site were very similar. Relative ascendency was 50% and relative redundancy was approximately 35% for both. The Finn Cycling Index was only slightly higher for the site without crabs, 36%, than the site with crabs, 34%. Therefore, though fiddler crabs dramatically affected how DIN was processed in the marsh, the overall nitrogen cycling properties at each site were remarkably similar.

AB  - Sediment organic matter (OM) content varies widely among salt marshes of the USA mid-Atlantic coastline. This study examined sulfur and carbon cycle processes (sulfate reduction rates, decomposition, and root production) that influence OM accumulation in marshes. Three treatments were established in two locations with different sediment characteristics in Phillips Creek Marsh (PCM) located at the Virginia Coast Reserve Long-Term Ecological Research (VCRLTER) site. Two of the experimental treatments were designed to alter the availability of terminal electron acceptors in sediment pore water by either removing fiddler crabs from areas with crab populations or by constructing artificial crab burrows in areas lacking crab populations. The third treatment, a reduced iron addition, was designed to lower pore-water sulfide concentrations. The results of the PCM experiments were used to explain the sediment OM content of six other marshes of the VCRLTER. The presence of crab burrows significantly increased decomposition and decreased root production compared to the crab burrow-free treatment. Short-form Spartina aferniflora root growth was correlated significantly with sulfate reduction rates but not pore-water sulfide concentration. Plots with low OM generally had higher pore-water sulfide and lower pore-water sulfate concentrations than plots with more OM content. These differences could not be explained by differences in the sulfate reduction rate constants. The higher measured infiltration rates in the high OM content plots suggested that pore-water sulfide and sulfate concentrations potentially were influenced by the effect of sediment texture on the exchange of solutes between tidal water and sediment pore water.

AB  - The potential influence of fiddler crab burrow density on the processes controlling organic matter (OM) accumulation was examined in Virginia salt marshes. As burrows may affect important chemical and biological processes that influence belowground plant production and decomposition, experimental manipulations were designed to modify fiddler crab burrow density by either increasing them (artificially constructed holes) or decreasing them (exclosures) and comparing them to areas naturally with and without fiddler crab burrows. The only significant difference among treatments was associated with the presence of holes without regard for whether they were artificial or natural. Higher burrow density resulted in an increase in soil redox potential, which most likely caused higher decomposition, even though sulfate-reduction rates were not different among treatments. Belowground production decreased with increased burrow density resulting in less OM addition to the soil. Higher decomposition and lower belowground production resulted in a net loss of 3 g C m(-2) yr(-1) in marshes with higher burrow densities, while areas with few to no burrows accumulated up to 245 g C m(-2) yr(-1), equaling a surface accretion rate of 4 mm yr(-1). Examination of 6 other salt marshes in the region revealed a negative correlation between fiddler crab density and soil OM content, lending strength to the argument that bioturbation is a potentially important explanatory factor of OM accumulation in salt marshes and may influence how sea level rise impacts coastal marshes.

AB  - Desiccation and thermal stress are among the primary factors limiting terrestriality in crustaceans. Water loss was estimated as weight change in five sympatric species of Uca from south Texas for periods up to 7 hr in dry air. Simultaneously, corporal temperature was measured with a thermocouple placed under the cara pace. To estimate integumental permeability to water, 115 mm(2) portions of dorsal carapace were glued to U-shaped tubes containing a crab Ringer's solution. These were exposed to dry air and water permeability was estimated from weight change. In whole-animal studies, most rapid weight loss occurred in the first 5 min of exposure to dry air as the body temperature fell below ambient (25 degrees C) in all species. The three most terrestrial species exhibited significant survival over more aquatic congeners after prolonged desiccation. The greatest rate of water loss was observed in Uca subcylindrica which lost 22.9 +/- 3.0% body weight. Uca panacea and Uca spinicarpa lost 14.1 +/- 1.6% and 18.5 +/- 1.8%, respectively. Based on blood osmolarity changes, Uca longisignalis and Uca rapax were more resistant to water loss than Uca subcylindrica under these conditions. Water loss from sections of the dorsal carapace were highest in Uca spinicarpa (10.4 mg/hr/cm(2)) and Uca longisignalis (8.9 mg/hr/cm(2)). Uca subcylindrica and Uca panacea were intermediate (4.5 and 4.2 mg/hr/cm(2)) while Uca rapax expressed the lowest value (2.9 mg/hr/cm2). These observations support the notion that water loss can effectively lower body temperature in fiddler crabs. However, an inverse relationship between terrestriality and integumental permeability was not evident in these sympatric congeners. Ultimately a balance between physiological and behavioral mechanisms must be achieved for adaptation to the semi-arid habitats in south Texas.

AB  - The locomotor activities of individual specimens of Uca subcylindrica (Stimpson) collected from semi-arid, supratidal habitats in south Texas and northeastern Mexico were studied in the laboratory using periodogram analysis. When crabs were placed under constant darkness (DD) or constant illumination (LL), free-running circadian rhythms were observed in the activity recordings. The locomotor activity of strongly rhythmic crabs in LL has an average period length of 24.4 h. Crabs held in DD express motor rhythms with periods of approximately 24.0 h. In LL the most common wave form for activity is unimodal, while under DD it is bimodal. Recordings under natural illumination (NL) revealed that both period length and the time of maximum activity (phasing) varied through the year. During winter months, the crabs are primarily diurnal with peaks in activity occurring between 0900 and 2100 h and possess a circadian rhythm with a 23.9 h period. During summer, crabs were nocturnal with maximal activity between 1300 and 0600 and a circadian period closer to 24.0 h. In these experiments, the rhythmic locomotor activities of U. subcylindrica are best described as “circadian”. This is unusual for a genus known for its expression of circatidal and circalunidian rhythms.

AB  - As problems in taxonomy and systematic relationships among the Uca species are resolved, a definition of how each fiddler crab species partitions and utilizes habitat resources is needed. To this end, the osmoregulatory capabilities were studied in six species of fiddler crabs from the western Gulf of Mexico. Specimens were placed in 50 ml of artificial seawater ranging in osmolality from 50 to 3450 mOsm (2 to 109 parts per thousand) for five days. Survivorship was recorded for each species. Uca rapax, U. panacea and U. subcylindrica are hardy from 200 to 3200 mOsm (6 to 101 parts per thousand). Uca spinicarpa and U. minax survive only below 1400 mOsm (44 parts per thousand). U. longisignalis is intermediate, with limited survival above 2500 mOsm (79 parts per thousand). Hemolymph osmolality was determined for crabs surviving the osmotic regimen. Uca panacea, U. subcylindrica and U. rapax are equivalent in their regulation between 50 and 3200 mOsm (2-101 parts per thousand). Uca longisignalis lost its ability to control hemolymph osmolality above 2200 mOsm (69 parts per thousand). On the other hand, U. spinicarpa and U. minax become less effective hyporegulators in media above 1200 (38 parts per thousand) and 1500 mOsm (47 parts per thousand), respectively. Only U. longisignalis appears to exhibit clear differences in osmoregulatory capacity between populations. Population data for U. panacea and laboratory experiments with U. subcylindrica also support the notion of capacitative acclimation in Uca. These physiological capabilities correlate well with the known habitat characteristics for each fiddler crab species in the northwestern Gulf of Mexico.

AB  - Fiddler crabs (Crustacea: Decapoda; genus Uca) were collected from 16 locations along the temperate Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico coasts of eastern North America for osmoregulation studies. Three species, U. pugilator, U. pugnax and U. minax, were taken from habitats between Cape Cod, MA, and St. Mary's River, Nassau Co., GA Seven species, U. panacea, U. speciosa, U. spinicarpa, U. longisignalis, U. rapax, U. pugilator and U. minax, were collected in habitats between the Ochlochonee River, Liberty Co., and Thompson's Bayou, Escambia Co., along the Gulf coast of northwest Florida. To examine differences in osmoregulatory capabilities among the species, specimens were placed in various concentrations of artificial seawater (0-3450 mOsm) for 5 days. The oligohaline or "freshwater" species, U. minax, U. spinicarpa and U. longisignalis, possess the lowest average hemolymph osmolality. They are unable to control hemolymph osmolality above 2000 mOsm. On the other hand, the euryhaline species, U. speciosa, U. panacea, U. pugilator and U. pugnax, have much higher average hemolymph osmolality. They are able to withstand an osmotic challenge of 2200 mOsm or greater. Among the eight species, U. panacea and U. pugilator are able to osmoregulate across the broadest range of seawater concentrations (0-2800 mOsm). After an examination of the osmoregulation in several populations of U. minax, U. pugilator and U. pugnax, physiological adaptation is apparent in the two former species, but not the latter. Experimental evidence for capacity adaptation was examined in the freshwater species, U. minax. If slowly adapted to hypertonic seawater (1800 mOsm) for 14 days, this species is able to withstand much higher osmotic pressures than unadapted crabs. Although hemolymph isosmotic concentration remains the same, the limits for regulation are extended to higher osmolality. Consequently, as a result of studying osmoregulation in several species of Uca captured at various locations across their geographic range in the temperate zone, a clearer view of water-balance physiology is available for the genus. The Uca spp. are not uniform in osmoregulatory abilities. There is considerable inter- and intraspecific physiological variation associated with the ecological distribution of each species, respectively.

AB  - Six species of fiddler crabs (Ocypodidae: Uca) were collected for osmoregulation studies from 25 locations near the delta of the Mississippi River in the northern Gulf of Mexico. Three of the species are classified as members of the Celuca subgenus, Uca spinicarpa, Uca panacea and Uca pugilator, while the remaining three are in the Minuca subgenus, Uca minax, Uca longisignalis and Uca rapax. In the field, U. ininax, U. spinicarpa and, occasionally, U. longisignalis are found in freshwater habitats (FW; 0-299 mosM). Two Minuca species, U. longisignalis and U. rapax, are typically collected in brackish water habitats (BW; 300-629 mosM). On the other hand, U. panacea and U. pugilator are most abundant in eurysaline habitats (EH; >630 mosM). In the laboratory, populations of each species were challenged with media ranging from 30 to 3450 mosM (1-110 parts per thousand). The FW species, U. spinicarpa and U. minax, did not tolerate osmotic concentrations >2100 mosM. The EH species, U. panacea and U. pugilator, however, tolerate concentrations >2800 mosM. The BW species, U. longisignalis and U. rapax, succumb to osmolalities between 2 100 and 2800 mosM. Each species keeps its hemolymph concentration fairly constant in 30-1400 mosM solutions. The [ISO], isosmotic medium concentration (in mosM), is calculated for each taxon: U. minax, 659,U. spinicarpa, 682; U longisignalis, 693; U. rapax, 769; U. pugilator, 816; and U. panacea, 822. In media with >1600 mosM, each species expresses different osmoregulating capabilities. The FW species, U. spinicarva and U. minax, cannot control hemolymph osmolality above 1500 mosM while the BW-EH species, U. panacea, U. pugilator and U. rapax, regulate hemolymph values in media up to 2300 mosM. Within the FW/BW species U. longisignalis, the ability to osmoregulate corresponds with site of collection. Specimens from FW populations do not regulate as well as those from BW if challenged with hypertonic media. If adapted to a 1800 mosM in the laboratory, survivorship for U. longisignalis shifts to the right and the [ISO] increases to 832 mosM. This suggests that this species adapts to acute hypertonic conditions by tolerating elevated internal osmolality. Generally, these observations extend our knowledge about the physiological capabilities of fiddler crabs from different salinity populations across the northern Gulf of Mexico.

AB  - Organisms living along the shore are exposed to complex sets of environmental oscillations. In addition to solar (24.0 h) and lunar (24.8 h) cycles, local tides may reoccur on a 12.4 h schedule. Beyond daily routines, biweekly, monthly and annual rhythms may each have a significant impact on an animal's activity. For some time, it has been established firmly that intertidal crabs possess several internal biological clocks with distinctly different periods and properties. However, the versatility of these clocks has not been obvious. Crabs living in the littoral zone must adjust their internal chronometers to be synchronous with the specific temporal structure of the immediate habitat. Fine adjustments in their clocks will depend upon on a particular tide province and the location of their niche in the intertidal zone. Over a wide geographic range, the location of an intertidal habitat for one species may be in as many as four tidal provinces. Based on wave form and harmonic components, tide provinces are characterized as either a) semidiurnal, b) mixed, mainly semidiurnal, c) mixed mainly diurnal, or d) diurnal. Likewise, the primary frequency associated with an intertidal niche in each tide province may be augmented by diel (24 h) and semilunar (14 day) periods. In addition, supralittoral habitats may be influenced by monthly (28 day) and seasonal rhythms. Since some species live in several tidal provinces and different positions in the littoral zone, locomotor and larval release rhythms of intertidal crabs must naturally be adjusted to the timetable of the local habitat. Flexibility in ambulatory and egg hatching rhythms of crabs are discussed from this environmental perspective. The nature and location of the underlying circadian and tidal oscillators tracking these environmental rhythms are reviewed.

AB  - Fiddler crabs are common in coastal habitats that differ greatly in salinity. To study water balance physiology in the genus Uca, thirteen species were collected from 86 locations ranging from 14 to 2080 mOsm along the shores of the Gulf of Mexico as well as the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans in the United States. Although most species are considered members of either the Celuca or the Minuca subgenus, one is a member of the Boboruca subgenus. Among the seven Celuca, five species exhibit distributions in habitats which are primarily euhaline or hypersaline, while two are primarily oligo- and mesohaline. Among five Minuca, two species are primarily oligo- to mesohaline and three are meso- to euhaline in their habitat preferences. The Boboruca species occupies primarily mesohaline habitats. Detailed osmoregulation studies were conducted in eleven species challenged with artificial sea water varying from 25 to 3550 mOsm. Through these studies, average survivorship, hemolymph-media osmotic relationship and isomotic hemolymph concentration ([ISO]) were determined for each. Within the Celuca subgenus, estimations of [ISO] vary from 845 to 888 mOsm in U. pugilator, U. panacea, U. subcylindrica, and U. crenulata. For U. speciosa and U. spinicarpa [ISO]s are 798 and 715 mOsm, respectively. For temperate species in the Minuca group, U. minax, U. longisignalis and U. pugnax, [ISO]s are 666, 693, and 879 mOsm, respectively. In the tropical species U. rapax the [ISO] is 775 mOsm. The [ISO] of the Boboruca representative, U. thayeri,, is 819 mOsm. Consequently, it appears that species with [ISO]s < 725 mOsm prefer oligohaline, between 725 and 820 mOsm inhabit mesohaline, and >820mOsm live in euhaline habitats. As a result of this investigation it appears that fundamental osmoregulatory capabilities and properties are fairly consistent within species. Variation in physiological properties among species is clearly related to phylogeny and ecology.

AB  - Fiddler crabs were collected for osmoregulation studies from 36 locations in Florida and one at Ocean Beach, California. The responses of five species of Uca from subtropical habitats along the Pacific, Atlantic, and Gulf of Mexico coasts of the U.S. to osmotic stress were examined and osmotic measurements are presented for the first time in three of the species. In artificial seawater (ASW) < 300 mOsm, Uca speciosa (Ives, 1891) Uca rapax (S. I. Smith, 1870), and Uca pugilator (Bosc, 1802) survived at lower concentrations than either Uca crenulata (Lockington, 1877) or Uca thayeri M. J. Rathbun, 1900. In ASW > 2500 mOsm, U. rapax, U. crenulata, and U. pugilator had higher survival than either U. speciosa or U. thayeri. Prior to measuring hemolymph osmolality, fiddler crabs were exposed to ASW ranging from 26 to 3550 mOsm for 5 d. The isosmotic hemolymph concentration ([ISO]) was estimated to range from 780 mOsm in U. rapax to 888 mOsm in U. crenulata. The pattern of acute acclimation to hypotonic ASW (195 mOsm) in two euryhaline species, U. crenulata and U. pugilator, was very similar. Results of this study indicate that U. crenulata and U. pugilator are better hyporegulators, enabling them to live in euhaline and hypersaline habitats. Due to a broad range of tolerance and low [ISO], U. rapax is best equipped for living in brackish habitats. In contrast, U. thayeri and U. speciosa are best suited physiologically to inhabit low and moderately saline habitats.

AB  - Specimens of the fiddler crab Uca subcylindrica (Stimpson) were captured in south Texas (USA) for locomotor rhythm studies. Actographic data were analyzed using Tau(TM) sofware. Under constant illumination (LL) and darkness (DD), the semiterrestrial crabs express a circadian rhythm of locomotion. When exposed to illumination/darkness cycles (LD12:12 or LD14:10), their bouts of activity are entrained to the photoperiod. In LD, activity is generally bimodal with an initial burst about 0.5 h after illumination. A second burst of activity begins 1 to 2 h before the end of illumination. When transferred from LD to LL, a locomotor rhythm with an average period of 24.6 +/- 1.0 h (n = 19) is expressed in 89 percent of the crabs. On the other hand, when placed in DD after LD (n = 8), the crabs are either arrythmic or weakly rhythmic (period = 23.8 +/- 0.2 h; n = 2). If the onset of illumination is advanced by 6 h, a period of loss than 24.0 h is detected in the actogram. If the onset of illumination is delayed by 6 h, a locomotor rhythm with a period greater than 24.0 h appears. The locomotor behavior of this species of fiddler crab, Uca subcylindrica, is not related to the tidal rhythmicities seen in other members of the genus Uca. Rather, it has strong circadian components.

AB  - Nine species of Uca were collected across the northern Caribbean from 50 locations ranging in habitat osmolality from 18 to 2760 mmol kg-1 (mosmol). The osmoregulating ability of each species was assessed in solutions ranging from 30 to 3550 mosmol. Survivorship, lower and upper median lethal concentration and haemolymph isosmotic concentration ([ISO]) were estimated for each. A lower lethal concentration could not be calculated for some due to survival in low osmolality. By subgenus, average [ISO] for four species from the subgenus Minuca ranged from 587 to 768 mosmol and three species from the subgenus Leptuca from 805 to 881 mosmol. For species from the subgenus Boboruca and the subgenus Uca the [ISO] was 805 and 930 mosmol, respectively. These values reflect the habitat preference of each species in a subgenus. This study broadens our understanding of ecological physiology in Caribbean Uca and demonstrates intra- and inter-specific differences among tropical fiddler crabs.

AB  - The ability to regulate the osmolarity of internal body fluids has not been examined in many species of Caribbean fiddler crabs. Nine species of Uca were collected from 17 locations in Belize, the Bahamas, Jamaica, and the U.S. Virgin Islands in the Greater Antilles. Habitat osmolality ranged from 18 to 2760 mOsm (0.6 to ~87 o/oo). Each species was associated with a distinct mOsm range: mordax 18-386, burgersi 34-1149, vocator 122-386, rapax 386-2760, thayeri 924-1088, cumulanta 1037, major 1129, speciosa 1149, leptodactyla 99-1149. Crabs were flown to a laboratory in Iowa to study their osmoregulating ability in 30 to 3550 mOsm (~1 to ~113 o/oo) over 5 days. Osmolality was measured using vapor pressure osmometry. For each population and species, survivorship, lower and upper median lethal concentrations (LC50), and hemolymph isotonic concentration ([ISO]) were estimated. Since some survived 5 days in deionized water, a lower LC50 could not be calculated (-) in every case. The lower and upper LD50s are estimated in mOsm as: mordax: - & 1619; burgersi: - & 2566; vocator: - & 1993; rapax: - & 3373; thayeri: 85 & 2090; leptodactyla: 58 & 2857; cumulanta: 58 & 2194, speciosa: - & 2958; major: 91 & 2672. Considering the Uca by subgenus, average [ISO] for Minuca ranges from 587 to 768 mOsm while for Leptuca it ranges from 805 to 881 mOsm. The [ISO] for thayeri and major is 805 and 930 mOsm, respectively. Furthermore, the mean [ISO] for each species reflects a preference for either an oligo-, meso-, or euhaline habitat. This study broadens our understanding of ecological physiology in Caribbean Uca and demonstrates intra- and interspecific differences among their tropical populations.

AB  - Melatonin and N-acetyltransferase (NAT) activity were measured in the eyestalks of fiddler crabs acclimated to various photoperiods: constant light, a L:D 12:12 h photoperiod, or constant dark. Following acclimation, eyestalks were collected every 3 h over a 24-h period; they were assayed for melatonin with a radioimmunoassay and for NAT activity with a radioenzymatic assay. In constant light, melatonin levels increased at 1300 h, from 142 to 431 pg mg(-1) eyestalk; NAT activity increased concurrently, from 97 to 203 pmol h(-1) mg(- 1) eyestalk, and both remained elevated until 0400 h. In the L:D 12:12 h photoperiod, melatonin levels increased at 1300 h from 28 to 230 pg mg(-1) eyestalk, and though NAT activity increased significantly, from 80 to 122 pmol h(-1) mg(-1) eyestalk, an even greater increase occurred at 0400 h, when melatonin levels were low. In constant dark, melatonin levels increased at 1600 h, from 22 to 196 pg mg(-1) eyestalk, with a concurrent increase in NAT activity from 93 to 140 pmol mg(-1) h(-1) eyestalk. However, the second peak in melatonin (111 pg mg(-1)), occurring at 0400 h, was out of phase with the second peak of NAT activity (113 pmol mg(-1) h(-1) eyestalk) which occurred at 0700 h. NAT may be a rate-limiting step in melatonin synthesis in fiddler crabs under some conditions (constant light and the 1300 h peak in constant dark); however, NAT activity correlates poorly with melatonin levels in a L:D 12:12 h photoperiod and in constant dark relative to the 0400 h melatonin peak.

AB  - Melatonin was injected into intact and eyestalk-ablated fiddler crabs (Uca pugilator), and its effects on hemolymph glucose and lactate levels were studied. In intact crabs, glucose and lactate levels cycled simultaneously, with peaks occurring during early and late photophase. Melatonin caused a shift in the glucose and lactate cycles, with only one peak occurring closer to mid-photophase. In eyestalk-ablated animals, the glucose rhythmicity was lost; lactate cycled, but levels were significantly lower than in intact animals. Melatonin caused a delayed hyperglycemia in eyestalk-ablated animals, with concurrent but much lower increases in lactate. Overall, melatonin demonstrated delayed hyperglycemic effects that do not appear to be mediated solely via eyestalk factors such as crustacean hyperglycemic hormone (CHH), though involvement of the eyestalks cannot be ruled out. An influence on extra- eyestalk CHH secretion is a potential mechanism of melatonin activity. (C) 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Melatonin was measured over 24 hr in the eyestalks of Uca pugilator by means of radioimmunoassay; crabs were acclimatized either to a LD 12:12 photoperiod or constant darkness. A significant peak occurred at 13.00 hr in the LD 12:12 crabs. A photophase peak in melatonin has only been reported in one other species, also a crustacean. In constant darkness, two melatonin peaks occurred, one at 16.00 hr and the other 12 hr later; these results suggest that the melatonin cycle is a true circadian rhythm. HPLC with ultraviolet-visible detection was used to confirm the identity of melatonin immunoactivity. The influence of melatonin on regeneration of the walking legs was also examined: eyestalks were either removed or left intact, and limb bud length was measured every other day for at least 17 days in control and melatonin-treated crabs (60 mu g ml(-1) seawater). Melatonin significantly increased the rate of limb regeneration in both eyestalk-intact and eyestalk-removed groups; this is contrary to results of regeneration studies in other phyla, in which similar melatonin concentrations inhibited regeneration.

AB  - The influence of melatonin on locomotor activity levels was measured in the fiddler crab Uca pugilator. First, activity in untreated, laboratory-acclimated crabs was measured over 48 hours in a 12L:12D photoperiod; this study showed a nocturnal increase in activity. In eyestalk-ablated crabs, overall activity was significantly reduced, and no significant activity pattern occurred. Next, crabs were injected with melatonin or saline (controls) at various times during the 12L:12D photoperiod (0900h, 1200h, and twice at 2100h; each trial was separated by 3-4 days) and monitored for 3 hr post-injection. Control crabs had low activity during early photophase, high at mid-photophase, increasing activity during the first scotophase trial, and decreasing activity during the second scotophase trial. Melatonin had no significant influence on activity when injected during the early-photophase activity trough or early- scotophase activity decline, but significantly increased activity when injected during the mid-photophase activity peak and early-scotophase activity incline. Next, crabs were injected during an early scotophase activity trough and monitored throughout the twelve-hour scotophase. Melatonin did not increase activity until the mid-scotophase activity increase, approximately 6 hours later, showing that the pharmacological dosage persisted in the crabs' systems and had later effects during the incline and peak of activity but not the trough. Eyestalk-ablated crabs were injected with melatonin or saline during early photo- and scotophase. Melatonin significantly increased activity in the photophase but not the scotophase trial, indicating that the responsiveness to melatonin continues following eyestalk removal, but the timing may not match that of intact crabs. Melatonin may be involved in the transmission of environmental timing information from the eyestalks to locomotor centers in U. pugilator. (C) 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Variations in egg Volume and fatty acid (FA) content through embryogenesis were evaluated in Uca species from Inhaca island, Mozambique. Egg volume increased 96.1%, 93.3%, 84.2%. 92.9%, 96.3%. respectively, in Uca annulipes, Uca inversa, Uca urvillei, Uca chlorophthalmus and Uca vocans (p < 0.05). Fatty acid content decreased through embryogenesis, showing its importance as fuel during embryonic development. Major fatty acids were 16:0,18:0,16:1 n-7,18:1 n-9,18:1 n-7,18:2n-6, 20:5n-3 and 20:4n-3. Unsaturated fatty acids (UFA) and saturated fatty acids (SFA) were used up at a similar rate for U. annulipes and U. inversa contrarily to the other three species. Within the UFA, MUFA were more consumed than PUFA for all species except U. chlorophthalmus. The high values detected for fatty acid trophic markers (essential C(18) and C(20) PUFAs) and odd-numbered fatty acid suggest that Uca species occupy medium trophic level, primarily omnivores and scavengers/detritivores consuming algae common in the intertidal habitats. The fatty acid consumption pattern during embryonic development was essentially similar between species with some variation as expected, as FA content varies within species mainly due to female feeding ecology, nutritional and physiological conditions, differential demands on resource allocation and geographic and seasonal variations in embryonic development.

AB  - In this study four species of fiddler crabs (Uca) at Inhaca Island, Mozambique, were studied: their fecundity determined and egg loss between the first and last embryonic development stage evaluated. Ovigerous female crabs were collected throughout February to March (wet season) of 2006, during day-time at low tide, in Ponta Rasa (U. annulipes and U. inversa) and Saco (U. chlorophthalmus and U. vocans) mangroves. Average brood size increased significantly with female and species size, ranging from 932 (CW = 8.51 mm) in U. annulipes, to 18,057 (CW = 23.5 mm) in U. vocans. The number of embryos decreased significantly over the incubation period for each species. Brood loss from embryonic stage I to stage IV for U. annulipes, U. inversa, U. chlorophthalmus and U. vocans was 12.3%, 14%, 43.2% and 23.6%, respectively (P < 0.05). Positive allometry was recorded for all species in the early development stage, however, due to the higher relative brood loss in larger females (U. vocans), when comparing the number of embryos in late developmental stage, a negative allometry was possible to observe. The average volume of embryos at the same stage differed among species although significant differences were found between embryonic stages for all species. Embryo volume increased 96.1%, 93.3%, 92.9% and 96.3% in, respectively, U. annulipes, U. inversa, U. chlorophthalmus and U. vocans (P < 0.05). Differences in brood loss were attributed to habitat substrate and structure, stress factors and behavioural aspects.

AB  - Crustaceans are limited to discontinuous growth due to their rigid exoskeleton. In order to grow they must shed their exoskeleton periodically. The crustacean exoskeleton is made up of chitin, proteins and minerals. It has previously been shown that activities of chitinolytic enzymes, chitinase and chitobiase, in the epidermis are inducible by the molting hormone. This study was undertaken to investigate whether collagenase activities in the epidermis are also under control of the molting hormone using the fiddler crab, Uca pugilator, as the model. We found that collagenase activities vary during the molting cycle and injection of 20-hydroxyecdysone induces epidermal collagenase activities. These results strongly suggest that epidermal collagenase activities in Uca pugilator are regulated by the molting hormone. This is the first report on epidermal collagenase activities and their inducibility by an ecdysteroid in a crustacean.

AB  - Oblique hauls of a 61 cm bongo sampler (0.505 mm mesh) at 33 stations yielded 66 kinds and at least 20 families of anomurans and brachyurans. Wet displacement plankton volumes (fishes removed) ranged from 4.8-88.0 ml with < 1.0-27.0% reptant larvae. Callinectes spp. and Portunus spp. were the only reptants occurring at all stations and were 1st and 3rd, respectively, in overall abundance. First and 2nd zoeal stages of Callinectes spp. were most abundant at nearshore stations; more advanced stages were predominant offshore. Larvae of fiddler crabs, Uca spp., were 2nd in overall abundance but occurred at only 24 stations. The data support patterns of megalopal and postlarval recruitment to estuarine areas by Callinectes spp., Uca spp., Pagurus pollicaris and Clibanarius vittatus.

AB  - The midgut chymotrypsins (EC 3.4.4.5) of three species of shrimps, Penaeus monodon, Penaeus japonicus and Penaeus penicillatus were purified and studied in detail to clarify previous ambiguity in their identification. In each of the species there are two major forms of chymotrypsin, both single-chained with three disulfide bonds. One has a pI of 3.2 and M(r) 27 000 or 28 000, while the other has a pI of 3.0 and M(r) 25 000 or 26 000. The N-terminal amino acid sequences of the P. monodon enzymes are homologous to those of the crab (Uca pugilator) collagenase and to the other chymotrypsins. However, the active sites of the shrimp chymotrypsins are different from that of the well studied bovine alpha-chymotrypsin in some respects: (1) in spite of showing the typical specificity of chymotrypsin, the shrimp enzymes are more stringently selective for substrates with extended polypeptide chain; (2) some titration agents of alpha-chymotrypsin, including t-cinnamoylimidazole, 4-nitrophenyl guanidinobenzoate and its fluorescent derivative, do not react with the shrimp enzymes, neither do some of the alpha-chymotrypsin inhibitors: Tosyl-PheCH2Cl, methyl-4-nitrobenzenesulfonate and benzeneboronic acid; (3) the shrimp chymotrypsins are more reactive than the bovine enzyme toward native protein substrates including collagen; (4) the kinetic-salt-effects of the shrimp enzyme toward N-succinyl- and acetyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-4-nitroanilide mainly reflect electrostatic rather than hydrophobic interactions between the substrates and the enzyme. The shrimp enzymes are acid-labile but resistent to autolysis. Our results suggest that most Crustacea decapods contain chymotrypsins as one of the major digestive endopeptidases.

AB  - Because of their diverse habitats, crabs are excellent experimental species to study owing to the morphological changes and physiological adaptation that occur during their terrestrial invasion. Their hemolymphic osmoregulation in brackish water is crucial for a successful terrestrial invasion. Crabs can actively uptake or excrete ions upon salinity change, and the gills play a major role among the osmoregulatory organs. Several enzymes are involved in the osmoregulatory process, including Na+, K+-ATPase and V-type H+-ATPase (V-H+-ATPase). Na+, K+-ATPase is the driving force in establishing an ion gradient across the epithelial cell membrane in marine crabs. It has been reported that the osmoregulatory mechanisms in freshwater crabs are different from those in marine ones, suggesting that the driving force may come from V-H+-ATPase by generating the H+ ion gradient to facilitate the ion flow. Thirteen crab species from two families were used in this study. These crabs lived in five different habitats, including marine, intertidal, bimodal, freshwater and terrestrial habitats. The distribution of V-H+-ATPase in the 13 euryhaline crabs was revealed by histochemistry. V-H+-ATPase was localized in the apical region in crabs that could survive in the freshwater environment. We found that the freshwater and terrestrial crabs with stable Na+, K+-ATPase activity during salinity changes tended to have an apical V-H+-ATPase, whereas the intertidal ones with varying Na+, K+-ATPase activity showed a cytoplasmic V-H+-ATPase distribution. Finally, in Uca formosensis, a crab that had stable Na+,K+-ATPase activity, a significant difference in V-H+-ATPase activity between salinities was found. In conclusion, the hypothesis that V-H+-ATPase plays a crucial role in the freshwater adaptation of crabs is supported by our systemic investigation on 13 euryhaline crabs.

AB  - Natural adaptation analysis is defined as analyzing the biochemical evolution of an organism to fit an ecological niche. At a molecular level, natural adaptation analysis illustrates how proteins evolve novel function by modifying existing structures. This thesis addresses the natural adaptation of the chymotrypsin family of serine proteases to cleave collagen. The degradation of collagen, the major structural protein in animals, is central to normal growth and development, as well as disease states such as arthritis and cancer. The molecular biology, biochemistry and structural biology of collagenolytic serine protease 1 from the fiddler crab, Uca pugilator, has been investigated. This enzyme possesses an unusually broad substrate specificity, encompassing those of trypsin, chymotrypsin, elastase and interstitial metallocollagenase. A unique arrangement of amino acids, including Gly 189 and Asp 226, in the primary binding pocket is thought to confer these specificities. Site-directed mutagenesis of trypsin was used to model the specificity determinants of crab collagenase. The resulting trypsin variants were characterized biochemically and crystallographically. A novel purification scheme was developed to isolate native collagenase from the fiddler crab hepatopancreas. The collagen specificity of the enzyme was determined and matched that for synthetic peptides. The primary collagen cleavage site is adjacent to that of the interstitial metallocollagenase. The crystal structure of crab collagenase was solved, providing the first view of an intact collagenolytic enzyme. Crab collagenase was cloned from a hepatopancreas cDNA library and expressed in S. cerevisiae. Quantitative structure-activity relationships determined that the collagenase active site is unique to the enzyme family. Site-directed mutagenesis of collagenase demonstrated that the primary substrate binding pocket has independent binding sites for basic and hydrophobic amino acids. A structural model for collagen recognition is presented. Modification of enzyme surface loops allows accessibility to and extended binding of the collagen triple helix. This natural adaptation analysis of crab collagenase will enable further studies to elucidate the molecular determinants of collagen recognition.

AB  - Uca pugilator serine collagenase 1 was cloned and sequenced from a fiddler crab hepatopancreas cDNA library. A full-length sequence encodes a 270-amino acid pre-pro-enzyme highly identical in structure to the chymotrypsin family of serine proteases. The zymogen form of the enzyme was expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a fusion with the alpha-factor signal sequence under control of the alcohol dehydrogenase/glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase promoter. Upon activation with trypsin, the recombinant collagenase possesses collagenolytic properties identical to those of the enzyme isolated from the crab hepatopancreas. The collagenase substrate binding pocket recognizes a wide range of basic, hydrophobic, and neutral polar residues. beta-Branched and acidic amino acids are poor substrates. Acylation is rate-limiting for collagenase versus peptidyl amides, rather than deacylation, as for trypsin and chymotrypsin. Correlations relating substrate volume and hydrophobicity to catalysis were found for collagenase and compared to those for chymotrypsin and elastase. Relative enzyme efficiencies on single amino acid versus tetrapeptide amide substrates show that collagenase derives less catalytic efficiency from binding of the primary substrate residue than trypsin or chymotrypsin, but compensates in binding of the extended peptidyl residues. Serine collagenase 1 is a novel member of the chymotrypsin protease family, by virtue of its amino acid sequence and multifunctional active site.

AB  - Crab collagenolytic serine protease 1 efficiently cleaves peptide bonds directly C-terminal to basic, polar, and hydrophobic amino acids. The crystal structure of this enzyme complexed to the protein inhibitor ecotin at 2.5 A resolution reveals a large primary binding pocket punctuated on one wall by the side chain of aspartate-226. Removal or relocation of this negatively charged group by site-directed mutagenesis generates variant enzymes which retain very high activities toward selected substrates. Full retention of activity toward hydrophobic substrates in collagenase D226G is accompanied by a 10-100-fold reduction in k(cat)/K-m toward basic residues. In contrast, restoration of the negative charge in a trypsin-like position in collagenase D226G/G189D regenerates nearly full activity toward basic substrates while introducing a 5-fold decrease in k(cat)/K-m toward hydrophobic amino acids. These results imply that the collagenase S1 pocket has multiple distinct binding sites for different amino acid side chains, a suggestion supported by molecular modeling studies based on the crystal structure. The ease of specificity modification in the primary binding site of this serine protease parallels similar observations with the bacterial enzymes alpha-lytic protease and subtilisin, and stands in sharp distinction to the extensive mutagenesis required to alter specificity in trypsin.

AB  - Affinity-based purification and characterization of the collagenolytic serine protease 1 from Uca pugilator (fiddler crab) hepatopancreas shows that the enzyme cleaves the native bovine alpha 1(I) collagen chain carboxyl-terminal to Gln and Arg residues adjacent to the metallocollagenase site. Cleavage carboxyl-terminal to Leu residues is observed in the alpha 2(I) chain and at a secondary site in alpha 1(I). These sites correlate with the prefer ences observed toward p-nitroanilide substrates varying at the P1 position, for which the specificity (k(cat)/K-m) is Arg > Leu, Phe, Lys > Gin > Ala. Furthermore, collagen cleavage after Gln was found exclusively between two Gln-Arg bonds. The P'1-P'3 specificity of collagenase, as determined by nucleophile acyl transfer, indicated a strong preference for Arg in the P'1 position. Crab collagenase cleaves peptide bonds adjacent to Leu and Gln at the P1 position more efficiently than trypsin, chymotrypsin, or elastase. Moreover, the efficiency of collagenase toward P1-Arg substrates is equivalent to that of trypsin. Crystals of crab collagenase have been grown complexed with the protein inhibitor ecotin. These crystals diffract to better than 2.8 Angstrom resolution and belong to the space group P3(2)21 with unit cell dimensions of a = b = 89.0 Angstrom, c = 291.7 Angstrom.

From 76-79% of the dietary volume was the salt marsh periwinkle (Littorina irrorata); crabs (Uca pugnax, Sesarma reticulatum, and Callinectes sapidus), barnacles (Balanus), and clams (Polynesoda caroliniana) constituted the remainder. Dietary partitioning is related to the ontogenetic niche of terrapins. Sexual dimorphism occurs in terrapins with females having larger heads and bodies than males. Terrapins with large head widths ingest significantly larger periwinkles and a wider diversity of prey than terrapins with small head widths. Dietary overlap between males and females is greatest when females are small and decreases as females develop larger enlarged heads. Sexual dimorphism in terrapin trophic structures appears to be partially driven by ecological divergence through resource partitioning. High tides permit terrapins to forage aquatically in upper reaches of the salt marsh. Prey size and distribution are variable and changing tidal heights affect the spatiotemporal availability of prey to foraging terrapins. Divergent foraging strategies for terrapins of different head widths may result in habitat partitioning. Food accessibility rather than food abundance may be a limiting factor for terrapins in areas of high tidal variability. Terrapins are clearly prominent but unrecognized macroconsumers in salt marsh ecosystems.

AB  - Diamondback terrapins (Malaclemys terrapin) do not eat the common and abundant mud snail (ilyanassa obsoleta) even though terrapin diets are dominated by similarly sized gastropods. To resolve this paradox, we tested a structural defense hypothesis as the potential deterrent against predation. We compared resistance to compressive force of ilyanassa and three invertebrates (Littorina irrorata,) Uca spp, and Callinectes sapidus) that terrapins commonly eat. Ilyanassa shells were 2-3 times more resistant to crushing than the other prey. High processing costs for mud snails (in terms of structural resistance to crushing) may deter predation by terrapins despite the low search costs and equivalent energetic returns relative to alternative prey items.

AB  - Dual stable isotope signatures (delta C-13 and delta N-15) were applied to determine the contribution of mangrove materials and other organic carbon sources to the invertebrate community in an ecologically important mangrove ecosystem of Vietnam. We have analyzed 181 specimens of 30 invertebrate species and found delta C-13 and delta N-15 ranging from -14.5 to -26.8% and from 1.3 to 12.1%., respectively. From taxa measured for stable isotopes, polychaete, gastropods, bivalves, and grapsid crabs living in mangrove forest showed relative low delta C-13 values, while fiddler crabs inhabiting in the land-water ecotone showed the highest delta C-13 values. The delta C-13 showed that just a few mangrove inhabitants directly relied on the mangrove materials. The wide ranges of delta C-13 and delta N-15 signatures indicated that the invertebrates utilized heterogeneous diets, comprising benthic microalgae, marine phytoplankton, particulate organic matter, sediment organic matter, mangrove detritus, and meiofauna and rotten animal tissues as the supplemental nutrient food sources. Moreover, the significant correlation between delta C-13 values and body sizes of invertebrates showed that snails Littoraria melanostoma and Terebralia sulcata, bivalve Glauconome virens, and portunid crab Scylla serrata exhibited ontogenetic shifts in diets. The present study showed that adjacent habitats such as tidal flat and mangrove creeks seem to contribute an important microalgal food resource for invertebrates and highlighted the need for conservations of mangrove forests and the adjacent habitats.

AB  - We determined the potencies of the pigment-dispersing hormones, alpha-PDH and beta-PDH, and the red pigment-concentrating hormone, RPCH, by the standard activity method in the marine isopod Ligia exotica, the fiddler crab Uca rapax, and the freshwater shrimp Macrobrachium acanthurus. In U. rapax, both PDHs exhibited the same dose-dependent activity, maximal dispersion being achieved at 3. 0 pmol/animal; in L. exotica, alpha-PDH bad a dose-related effect, with maximal pigment dispersion at 100 pmol/animal, and only a partial, dose-independent dispersion was elicited by beta-PDH; in M. acanthurus, alpha-PDH caused a dose-dependent pigment dispersion, with maximal response at 3,000 pmol/animal whereas beta-PDH had no effect. There seems to be more similarity between L. exotica and Pandalus borealis PDH receptors than between L. exotica and U. rapax receptors, suggesting an evolutionary convergence of the dispersing chromatophorotropins and their receptor molecules. Concerning RPCH, no pigment aggregation was observed in melanophores of U. rapax or L. exotica, but full aggregating response was obtained in M. acanthurus erythrophores at 10 pmol/animal. Although these results point to differences between erythrophore and melanophore responses to RPCH, we should also keep in mind the possibility that different evolutionary patterns undergone by the three groups of crustaceans may have led to remarkable receptor variability.

AB  - The Alabama redbelly turtle is an endangered freshwater turtle endemic to the Mobile--Tensaw delta area of Alabama. The diet of the Alabama redbelly turtle, Pseudemys alabamensis , was examined using a modified stomach flushing technique. Aquatic trapping was conducted from May to September during 1999 and 2000. Turtles were collected and sampled from three areas in Baldwin county: Gravine Island (57 females, 6 males), the Causeway (Hwy 90) (9 females, 1 male) and Weeks Bay (7 females). There were more females captured than males (177:33), which may indicate a skewed sex ratio for this species. The diets consisted primarily of submerged aquatic vegetation, although remains of blue crabs and fiddler crabs were occasionally encountered. Dietary composition varied with respect to area but not sex. Hydrilla verticillata , an introduced plant, was the dominant species in the diets of turtles collected at Gravine Island. Two native plant species, Najas guadalupensis and Vallisneria americana , dominated the diets of turtles sampled from the Causeway and Weeks Bay areas. In all locations turtles ate the dominant vegetation. There was a 2.4% mortality associated with the flushing technique; the deaths were attributed to ruptured esophagi.

AB  - Natural and sexual selection are frequently invoked as causes of sexual size dimorphism in animals. Many species of turtles, including the Diamond-backed Terrapin (Malaclemys terrapin), exhibit sexual dimorphism in body size, possibly enabling the sexes to exploit different resources and reduce intraspecific competition. Female terrapins not only have larger body sizes but also disproportionately larger skulls and jaws relative to males. To better understand the relationship between skull morphology and terrapin feeding ecology, we measured the in-lever to out-lever ratios of 27 male and 33 female terrapin jaws to evaluate biomechanics of the trophic apparatus. In addition, we measured prey handling times by feeding Fiddler Crabs (Uca pugnax), a natural prey item, to 24 terrapins in the laboratory. Our results indicate that although females have disproportionately larger heads, they have similar in: out lever ratios to males, suggesting that differences in adductor muscle mass are more important in determining bite force than jaw in: out lever ratios. Females also had considerably reduced prey handling times. Understanding the factors affecting terrapin feeding ecology can illuminate the potential roles male and female terrapins play as top-down predators that regulate grazing of Periwinkle Snails (Littorina irrorata) on Cord Grass (Spartina alterniflora).

AB  - In this work, we evaluated the relationship between swimming speed and size of megalopae of the crabs Uca uruguayensis, Chasmagnathus granulata, Cyrotograpsus angulatus and C. altimanus in a flume and compared the results with the available information for other crab megalopae. Megalopa swimming speeds ranged from 1.4 cm s(-1) to 13.2 cm s(-1) in C. granulata, 1.02 cm s(-1) to 14.9 cm s(-1) in C. angulatus, 1.2 to 6.9 in U. uruguayensis, and 3.3 to 20.8 in C. altimanus. The results of our experiments together with the available information show that, contrary to what is stated in the current literature for larvae of similar size, size is a good indicator of swimming speed for crab megalopae. Furthermore, our results suggest that general models describing the relationship between size and swimming speed largely underestimate the average and maximum swimming speed of megalopae.

AB  - Ecdysteroids are steroid hormones that regulate growth, development, reproduction, and molting in arthropods. The functional ecdysteroid receptor is a heterodimer of the ecdysone receptor (EcR) and a vertebrate retinoid-X receptor (RXR) ortholog, ultraspiracle (USP) in insects or RXR in crustaceans. EcR/RXR heterodimers bind to hormone response elements within the genome to induce expression of early response genes. These early response gene products are transcription factors that induce an ecdysteroid cascade of gene expression. The retinoid X receptor (RXR) is a member of nuclear hormone receptor family proteins. RXR contains two signature domains of nuclear receptor family proteins, namely the DNA-binding domain (DBD) and ligand-binding domain (LBD). The T-box region, located between the DBD and LBD, influences DNA binding properties of the heterodimer. There are multiple isoforms of RXR in the land crab, Gecarcinus lateralis, and fiddler crab, Uca pugilator, which differ in the T-box and LBD. Three partial cDNA sequences encompassing the T-box region of the green crab RXR were cloned using RT-PCR. Two cDNAs were similar to the T(+7) and T(+12) isoforms from land and fiddler crabs. The third encoded a novel sequence, designated the T(+10) isoform. Here we report the use of PCR and high-resolution gel electrophoresis to examine the expression of the three T-box isoforms of green crab RXR in response to elevated ecdysteroids.

AB  - Epixanthus dentatus (Crustacea: Brachyura: Eriphiidae) is a predator crab, commonly inhabiting East African mangroves, whose nocturnal and elusive behaviour usually prevents analysis of its natural diet and prey selection. The present study was carried out on it population inhabiting a peculiar mangrove habitat in which E. dentatus produces heaps of non-ingested parts of its prey. Fifty-nine of these accumulations of prey remains were examined and 17 species were identified as part of the diet of E. dentatus. Relative prey consumption was then analysed with respect to the relative abundance of prey species within the local faunal community. This methodology provided important information about pi-ey selection by E. dentatus; in particular, gastropods were always strongly under-represented, while there was an active selection among the different crab species. Uca species were under-represented, while swimming crabs were also part of the E. dentatus diet, which shows that the latter is able to prey both at low and high tide.

AB  - Simulations in the laboratory were used to investigate whether survivorship rates of Ucides cordatus youngsters produced in the laboratory are significantly affected by other crab species after their release in natural environments. Furthermore, it was investigated whether the release of first instar juveniles instead of megalopae would reduce the mortality related to interspecific predation. A preliminary estimate of the crab community structure in the target area of a restocking program was undertaken and indicated a great dominance of fiddler crabs (Uca spp). Based on this information, experiments were conducted to assess the ecological relationship between Ucides cordatus megalopae and first instar juveniles and fiddler crabs of different size classes in the presence of mangrove sediment, simulating natural conditions, as well as in the absence of any kind of refuge. It was observed that fiddler crabs not only compete with, and prey on U. cordatus youngsters, both as megalopae and juveniles. Furthermore, it was observed that the predation behavior of fiddler crabs is exercised only by individuals with carapaces wider than 0.5 cm. The results of the assay simulating natural conditions showed that, even when sediment was provided as a refuge, the same pattern was observed, with survivorship rates significantly lower in the presence of Uca crabs.

AB  - The molt stages of the fiddler crab, Uca pugilator, are described with setal development and extent of epidermal retraction in pleopods as the major criteria for molt stage determination. Setogenic molt staging is a simple technique to use and produces no apparent adverse physiological effects. A single crab can be staged throughout an entire molt cycle using this technique. Setogenic molt staging may be performed using setae from several regions of the body. The molt cycle in Uca was divided into the following stages and substages: A-B, C, D(,0), D(,1), D(,2), and D(,3-4). The enzyme, B-glucosidase, was demonstrated to exist in the fiddler crab and was characterized by kinetic, temperature, pH sensitivity and reaction rate data. Levels of enzyme activity in the cuticle and epidermis were also determined in relation to the stages of the molt cycle. The V(,0) pH sensitivity data indicate an optimum pH of approximately 5.0. Temperature sensitivity data indicate an optimum temperature of approximately 80(DEGREES) C. The apparent Km and Vmax values of the crab B-glucosidase are 15.57mM PNPG and 0.0712mM PNPG/min respectively. The pH sensitivity and rate data suggest a multiplicity of forms for the exhibited enzyme activity. The temporal relationship of B-glucosidase activity with known molt cycle events suggests this enzyme is involved with protein sclerotization in the fiddler crab.

AB  - The selfish herd hypothesis predicts that aggregations form because individuals move toward one another to reduce predation risk. To test the selfish herd hypothesis, I studied sand fiddler crab ( Uca pugilator ) flocks being attacked by predators.

Fiddler crab flocks formed in the area where resources were highest, and flocks rapidly found and exploited food-enhanced experimental plots. Fiddler-crab flock formation peaked in the feeding area when potential predators were least abundant. Crabs in the feeding area were more likely to die by predation than were individuals who remained near their burrow. Fiddler crab behavior functions to minimize predation risk while maximizing the intake of food.

After recording 12 predatory attacks on crabs, I digitized the video on a computer, and found the positions of crabs. Crabs became closer together after panic initiation. The mean median Domain of Danger (the area closer to an individual than to any other) was significantly lower after panic initiation than beforehand. Fiddler crabs behave as predicted by the selfish herd hypothesis.

I used computer simulations to determine what simple movement rules might lead to selfish herd formation. Relative predation risk was different for each of six movement rules. Only the Local Crowded Horizon (LCH) rule, which allowed individuals to take the positions of multiple flock-mates into account, but decreased the influence of flock-mates with distance, satisfied the criteria for a good movement rule. The LCH rule was very sensitive to the animal's perceptive ability. Therefore, the animal's ability to detect its flock-mates is an important factor in the dynamics of group formation.

If the predator attacks from outside the group's perimeter, simple movement rules might not work. Therefore, I constructed a computer model that allowed crab flocks to react to a predator. The model simulated predators of different sizes and attack speeds. Regardless of the predator's size and speed, predation risk always decreased as long as crabs took their flock-mates into account. Thus, even when flight away from an external predator occurs, the selfish avoidance of danger can lead to aggregation.

AB  - According to the selfish herd hypothesis, animals can decrease predation risk by moving toward one another if the predator can appear anywhere and will attack the nearest target. Previous studies have shown that aggregations can form using simple movement rules designed to decrease each animal's Domain of Danger. However, if the predator attacks from outside the group's perimeter, these simple movement rules might not lead to aggregation. To test whether simple selfish movement rules would decrease predation risk for those situations when the predator attacks from outside the flock perimeter, we constructed a computer model that allowed flocks of 75 simulated fiddler crabs to react to one another, and to a predator attacking from 7 m away. We attacked simulated crab flocks with predators of different sizes and attack speeds, and computed relative predation risk after 120 time steps. Final trajectories showed flight toward the center of the flock, but curving away from the predator. Path curvature depended on the predator's size and approach speed. The average crab experienced a greater decrease in predation risk when the predator was small or slow moving. Regardless of the predator's size and speed, however, predation risk always decreased as long as crabs took their flock-mates into account. We conclude that, even when flight away from an external predator occurs, the selfish avoidance of danger can lead to aggregation. (C) 2001 Academic Press.

AB  - The selfish herd hypothesis predicts that aggregations form because individuals move toward one another to minimize their own predation risk. The "dilemma of the selfish herd" is that movement rules that are easy for individuals to follow, fail to produce true aggregations, while rules that produce aggregations require individual behavior so complex that one may doubt most animals can follow them. If natural selection at the individual level is responsible for herding behavior, a solution to the dilemma must exist. Using computer simulations, we examined four different movement rules. Relative predation risk was different for all four movement rules (p < 0.05). We defined three criteria for measuring the quality of a movement rule. A good movement rule should (a) be statistically likely to benefit an individual that follows it, (b) be something we can imagine most animals are capable of following, and (c) result in a centrally compact flock. The local crowded horizon rule, which allowed individuals to take the positions of many flock-mates into account, but decreased the influence of flock-mates with distance, best satisfied these criteria. The local crowded horizon rule was very sensitive to the animal's perceptive ability. Therefore, the animal's ability to detect its neighbors is an important factor in the dynamics of group formation.

AB  - The selfish herd hypothesis predicts that aggregations form because individuals move towards one another, and that this movement will minimize predation risk as measured by the domain of danger. To test the predictions of the selfish herd hypothesis in the field, we videotaped the movements of sand fiddler crab, Uca pugilator, flocks being attacked by predators. After recording 12 attacks on crabs by shorebird and human attackers, we digitized the video, and determined the positions of crabs before and after being frightened. We estimated the time of panic initiation by the rapid increase in the crabs' velocity. Crab flocks became more cohesive after panic initiation. The frequency distribution of the crabs' domains of danger shifted significantly towards smaller domains after panic initiation. The median domain of danger was significantly lower after panic initiation than beforehand. Two other indices of aggregation also showed statistically significant increases in flock cohesion following panic initiation. We conclude that fiddler crab behaviour is consistent with the selfish herd hypothesis. Therefore, our results support the selfish herd hypothesis as an explanation for gregarious behaviour.

AB  - Since 1979 it is known that, in Australian species of Uca, female waving exists in addition to usual male display. The present paper deals mainly with female waving in U. polita studied in Darwin (North Australia). A few remarks on U. dampieri, U. vomeris, U. seismella and U. hirsutimanus are added. The species mentioned are members of two species groups or subgenera, which characterizes female waving as an ancestral (plesiomorph) trait.

Frame by frame analysis of film sequences (open air shots) indicate homology of movements in the two sexes of U. polita. As in males, waving of females can be combined with locomotion on radial paths starting from the burrow entrance and the display is performed in series with a corresponding number of gestures. Unlike males, waving females mostly use both their chelipeds and tend to show shorter durations with regard to many of the waving parameters chosen. However, significant differences refer only to a limited number of parameters.

The biological context of female waving was gathered from films and field observations. High intensity waving is released by conspecifics approaching from far (wanderers without burrows) and from the neighbourhood. Typically, only females and small males elicit high intensity display in a resident female. Waving normally stops in presence of larger males, especially of the male living in a resident breeding unit with the female in question.

In spite of this, a pure agonistic (defensive) character of female waving is unlikely. Advertising of breeding condition seems to play a role similar to that in males. The few displaying females that exist in a given colony (about 2.5 % in U. polita) show signs of special sexual excitement: brightening of carapace colours and sometimes spontaneous performance of waving, i.e. display immediately after emergence from the burrow in absence of any conspecific.

AB  - The fiddler crab Uca arcuata (De Haan, 1835), which Lives on intertidal mud hats, occasionally builds a cylindrical mud chimney that encircles its burrow entrance. Chimneys were more often found with burrows of females than with those of males (22% versus 10%). For both sexes, smaller individuals were more likely to construct chimneys. Chimneys were more abundant during the periods of male waving activity (May-August), bur their abundance was unrelated to the semilunar tidal cycle. We experimentally demonstrated that individuals without burrows more often entered burrows without chimneys than burrows with chimneys. Because individuals compete for burrows, the function of chimney construction may be to decrease the likelihood that an individual loses its burrow to an opponent. The seasonal variation in chimney construction as well as differences in the probability of construction among various sex and size classes also support this conclusion.

AB  - Male fiddler crabs either produce lateral or vertical waves. The function of lateral waves is well documented, but vertical waves have been largely unexplored. Here we explore the function of vertical claw-waving by the Japanese fiddler crab Uca arcuata by examining the context in which males produced both directed waves (the waver is facing a nearby crab) and undirected waves (waving when no other crabs are present). There are two types of mating in this species: burrow mating (the male chases a female to his burrow and they mate underground); and surface mating (the male holds the female down and they mate on the surface). Attempted burrow matings were more likely to be preceded with directed waving at the female than were attempted surface matings (83% vs. 50%). All successful burrow matings were preceded by directed waving at the female, while only 50% of successful surface matings were preceded by directed waving. Undirected waving was given in the absence of a nearby crab. The frequency of undirected waving was not related to the number of males within a 60 cm radius around the male, but was negatively related to the number of females within that distance. This suggests that undirected waving acts as a long-range female attractant.

AB  - It is unclear whether the high variance of electromyographic parameters measured in feeding teleost fishes reflects functionally significant motor variation that is under control of the fish, or functionally insignificant variation characteristic of EMG data. We addressed this issue by examining the effect of three prey, differing in physical characteristics, on the feeding motor pattern in three fishes of the Order Tetraodontiformes: the filefish, Monacanthus hispidus; the triggerfish, Balistes capriscus; and the puffer, Sphoeroides nephelus. EMG recordings were made from subdivisions of the mouth closing adductor mandibulae muscle and the mouth opening levator operculi muscle in four fish from each species feeding on live fiddler crabs, live shrimp, and pieces of cut squid mantle. Analysis of variance was used to test for effects of prey type on the standard deviation of muscle burst duration, burst onset time, and average burst amplitude in the adductor muscles. The filefish exhibited a doubling of standard deviation of burst duration in all muscles when feeding on fiddler crabs; triggerfish showed increased standard deviations in onset times and duration of two muscles when feeding on squid mantle; and the puffer showed no effects of prey on motor variability. The observation that prey type can elicit more than a doubling in the standard deviation of some EMG traits indicates that a large portion of the within-prey type variance is under direct control of the individual fish, suggesting an even greater level of fine motor control in teleost feeding mechanisms than previously recognized.

AB  - Foraging fiddler crabs (Uca spp.) monitor the location of, and are able to return to, their burrows by employing path integration. This requires them to accurately measure both the directions and distances of their locomotory movements. Even though most fiddler crabs inhabit relatively flat terrain, they must cope with vertical features of their environment, such as sloping beaches, mounds and shells, which may represent significant obstacles. To determine whether fiddler crabs can successfully perform path integration among such three-dimensional obstacles, we tested their ability to measure distance while we imposed a vertical detour. By inserting a large hill in the homeward path of foraging crabs we show that fiddler crabs can cope with vertical detours: they accurately travel the correct horizontal distance, despite the fact that the shape of the hill forces them to change their gait from what would be used on flat ground. Our results demonstrate a flexible path integrator capable of measuring, and either integrating or discarding, the vertical dimension.

AB  - While on foraging excursions, fiddler crabs track their burrow location despite having no visual contact with it [1-5]. They do this by path integration [3, 6], a common navigational process in which motion vectors (the direction and distance of animals' movements) are summed to form a single "home vector" linking the current location with the point of origin [7]. Here, we identify the mechanism by which the integrator measures distance, by decoupling motor output from both inertial and visual feedback. Fiddler crabs were passively translated to a position such that the home vector lay across an acetate sheet on the ground. After being frightened, crabs tried to escape but slipped as they did so. Detailed high-speed video analysis reveals that crabs measure distance by integrating strides, rather than linear acceleration or optic flow: the number of steps they took depended on both the length of the home vector and how large their steps were, whether they slipped and fell short or not. This is the most direct evidence to date of a stride integrator [8, 9] that is flexible enough to account for significant variation in stride length and frequency.

AB  - Ecological functions of bioturbation in ecosystems have received increasing attention over the recent decades, and crab burrowing has been considered as one of the major bioturbations affecting the physical and chemical processes in salt marshes. This study assessed the integrated effects of crab excavating and burrow mimic trapping on sediment turnover and vertical C and N distributions in a Chinese salt marsh in the Yangtze River estuary. Crab burrowing increased soil water content and the turnover of carbon and nitrogen and decreased bulk soil density. Vertical movement of materials, nutrient cycling and reuse driven by crab burrowing might be obstructed by vegetation (Phragmites australis and Spartina alterniflora communities). The amount of soil excavated by crab burrowing was higher than that deposited into burrow mimics. In Phragmites marshes, Spartina marshes and unvegetated mudflats, net transport of soil to the marsh surface was 171.73, 109.54, and 374.95 g m(-2) d(-1), respectively; and the corresponding estimated soil turnover time was 2.89, 4.07 and 1.83 years, respectively. Crab burrowing in salt marshes can mix surface and deeper soil over a period of years, accelerating litter decomposition and promoting the efficient reuse of nutrients by plants. Therefore, bioturbation affects soil physical processes and functioning of ecosystems, and needs to be addressed in ecosystem management.

AB  - Endogenous rhythms allow most organisms to synchronize their behavior and physiology with physical cycles that vary on a daily, lunar or annual cycle. Populations within species often show variation in the timing of functionally identical rhythms. This variation occurs because physical cycles may differ with geography. The purpose of this study was to determine whether hatching rhythms shown by fiddler crabs (Genus Uca ) on one coastline could be entrained by the different tide patterns present at another coastline. To test this I transferred breeding females (Uca thayeri ) from mangroves on the west coast of Florida to mangroves on the east coast. On the west coast, females are exposed to "mixed" tides; most release their larvae during the day or night (early summer), or during the day (mid- to late summer). On the east coast, females are exposed to "semidiurnal" tides; they release their larvae between dusk and midnight. After four weeks of exposure to the East Coast tides, crabs from the West Coast showed hatching rhythms identical to the resident crabs. This change indicates that the crabs show behavioral (phenotypic) "plasticity". These observations provide further evidence for the adaptive value of behavioral plasticity.

AB  - Fiddler crabs (Uca thayeri) on Florida's east and west coasts show temporally distinct hatching rhythms, correlated with differences in tidal form. Our purpose in this study was to determine whether these differences were fixed or could change in response to variation in the tides. West coast crabs (but not east coast crabs) showed seasonal variation in their hatching rhythms correlated with seasonal variation in the tides. In the spring, they released larvae at night. In the summer, hatching occur-red during the day, West coast crabs transferred to Florida's east coast within four weeks released larvae at night in a rhythm similar to resident crabs but different from the spring nocturnal rhythm shown at their home beach. We conclude that this species has a flexible hatching rhythm that changes under natural, as well as under experimental, conditions. Such flexibility may permit the crabs to time larval release optimally over a range of tidal forms, This study and others published recently suggest that "plasticity" may be characteristic of behavioral rhythms shown by many intertidal crabs.

AB  - Floating mangrove leaves with associated organisms were sampled approximately every 1 h over 4 consecutive tidal cycles from 1 to 3 December 1987 in the estuary of Punta Morales, Gulf of Nicoya, Costa Rica. Crabs were the predomiant animals collected (77.8%), followed by shrimps, fishes and other crustaceans. The 4 most abundant decapod crustacean taxa found attached to the leaves were Uca, Callinectes, Paenaeus and Macrobrachium. Megalopal and juvenile stages of decapods, clingfish Tomicodon sp., as well as amphipods and isopods, were attached to the drifting leaves. Organisms were significantly more numerous during flood than ebb: mean totla number of individuals per leaf was one order of magnitude greater during incoming than during outgoing tide (2.3 versus 0.1). This transport mechanism may minimize both the risk of predation and the energy required to immigrate into the preferred habitat. This strategy may be improtant for recruitment of crabs and shrimps in mangrove ecosystems.

AB  - Terrestrial and semi-terrestrial crustaceans are exposed to fluctuations in ambient temperature and conditions that favor evaporative water loss. These environmental stresses alter performance limits in the laboratory and behavior in the field. The maximal rate of oxygen consumption, maximum aerobic speed, and endurance capacity are greater at a body temperature (T-b) of 24 degrees C than at 15 degrees C or 30 degrees C in the ghost crab, Ocypode quadrata. The total metabolic cost to move at the same relative speed is greater at a T-b of 24 degrees C than at 15 degrees C. Slower aerobic kinetics at 15 degrees C result in a smaller relative contribution of oxidative metabolism to total metabolic cost. However, the relative contributions from accelerated glycolysis are similar at both temperatures. When locomotion is intermittent, the total distance traveled before fatigue can be similar at T(b)s of 15 and 24 degrees C but result from different movement and pause durations at these temperatures. Performance limits of the ghost crab are negatively affected by dehydration and are sensitive to rates of water loss. In the laboratory, endurance capacity of the fiddler crab, Uca pugilator, is greater at a T-b of 30 degrees C than at 25 degrees C. In the field, freely moving fiddler crabs with a T-b of 30 degrees C travel at faster mean preferred speeds, as determined by motion analysis, than crabs at 25 degrees C. Data for Land crabs support and advance general ectothermic models for the effects of temperature and dehydration on locomotor performance.

AB  - 1. When kept under identical conditions, Uca pugnax regenerates limbs and molts more rapidly than U. pugilator from the same location. 2. The tropical species U. rapax and U. speciosa also regenerate faster than U. pugilator from the same location. U. thayeri is the slowest to replace missing limbs, the slowest to harden the carapace after ecdysis, and also requires the greatest injury before autotomy will take place. 3. When kept in groups, U. thayeri stops regeneration after basal growth and will not molt; U. pugilator is only slightly retarded when kept in groups. U. rapax is also affected by grouping, showing a lengthened proecdysial phase and terminal plateau, thus also delaying molting. 4. Newly regenerated limbs of U. rapax, U. thayeri, and U. speciosa, aside from being lighter than old limbs, have a conspicuous banding pattern. This pattern becomes less obvious during the week or two after ecdysis as melanophores move into the interband regions and the limb as a whole darkens due to increased dispersion of pigment in the melanophores. In U. pugilator the newly regenerated limbs are very pale in color and remain that way for several months under laboratory conditions, even when animals are maintained on a dark background. 5. When treated with 0.5 mg/liter methylmercury, growth was inhibited entirely in U. thayeri. Partial inhibition was seen in U. pugilator, and the least inhibition in U. rapax. A few individuals of U. rapax were able to complete regeneration and molt, but there was no melanin in the regenerated limbs. 6. Inhibition of melanogenesis in regenerated limbs was also seen in U. thayeri and to a smaller extent in U. pugilator at 0.1 mg/liter methylmercury. The lack of black pigment may be due to an inhibition of cell migration but more likely of melanin synthesis. Some of these crabs developed melanin when kept in clean water after ecdysis. 7. Seasonal differences were noted in all species, but especially in U. Thayeri. In this species, regenerated occurred much more rapidly in March-April than in January.

AB  - Killifish, grass shrimp, fiddler crabs, blue crabs, and young bluefish in contaminated estuaries differ ecologically from reference populations in relatively uncontaminated environments. All five of these species show reduced activity and feeding, but only fishes show reduced growth. In these areas, killifish are poor predators, eat much detritus, have poor predator avoidance, and are smaller and less abundant. Bluefish have reduced rates of feeding and growth. Both killifish and bluefish have altered thy mid glands and neurotransmitters, which may underlie behavioral changes. Shrimp in contaminated environments show unchanged levels of predator avoidance; compensatory energetic partitioning favors growth and reproduction despite reduced feeding. With less predation pressure, shrimp are larger and more numerous. Fiddler crabs tend to spend more time in burrows and experience reduced predation. With ample food, metal depuration through molting, and reduced population size, they grow larger. In contaminated estuaries, we've found that juvenile blue crabs are less likely to be eaten by adults; adults are impaired in prey capture but are larger, despite eating much detritus and algae. Release from top-down effects from humans-as a result of a fishery advisory-may allow crabs to live longer. It appears that differences in physiology and trophic interactions modify the effects of reduced feeding On the different species.

AB  - Fiddler crabs, Uca pugilator, collected from the field showed no avoidance to burrowing in 1 microgram g-1 tributyltin (TBT)-contaminated sand held in laboratory trays. Treatment of U. pugilator with levels of tributyltin as low as 0.5 microgram l-1 for 1-3 wk resulted in an acceleration of the righting reflex in females, indicative of hyperactivity. Crabs of both sexes exhibited a reduction in burrowing activity, as measured by the number of burrows dug at 15 and 60 min after release into laboratory trays containing sand, and by the number of crabs within burrows at those times. The reduction in burrowing activity was not dose-dependent at concentrations of 0.5 to 50 micrograms l-1, and was unchanged between one and three weeks of exposure. Since fiddler crabs are dependent on burrows for many aspects of their lives, the reduction in burrowing behavior, should it occur in nature, would have serious consequences for the species.

AB  - Green algae, Ulva lactuca (L.) and Enteromorpha intestinalis (L.), were collected from bulkheads made of wood treated with chromated copper arsenate (CCA). Control algae were collected from nearby rocks. Metal levels in the Ulva and Enteromorpha from the CCA dock were elevated substantially over control levels. Snails, Nassarius obsoletus (Say), collected from an area distant from CCA-wood, were placed with control or experimental Ulva or Enteromorpha. Snails feeding on experimental Ulva retracted into their shells and lay inactive on the bottom of the containers, a process that preceded death. Snails eating Enteromorpha followed. By 4 wk, all the experimental snails were retracted or dead, while all control snails remained active. Thus, metals in the treated wood are taken up by attached algae, and can be toxic to grazing herbivores. Oysters, Crassostrea virginica (Gmelin), were collected from a CCA dock, a bulkhead in a canal lined with CCA wood, and rocks (reference site). Animals from the single dock had elevated Cu, and those from the bulkhead had 12 times the reference levels of Cu, and significantly elevated As. Fiddler crabs, Uca pugilator (Bosc) and U. panacea (Salmon), were collected from burrows close to or distant from CCA-treated wood structures and were analysed for metal content. Those living near CCA wood had elevated metal content, as did the sediments in which they resided. This indicates that sediments, which can adsorb contaminants leached from CCA wood, are a route of exposure of benthic biota to these contaminants.

AB  - We studied the behaviors of four species of sympatric fiddler crabs on Kaledupa Island, Indonesia. Species differences in activity level, grooming, burrowing and feeding were related to their habitat and food. Uca chlorophthalmus, living in muddy mangrove areas, were inactive and spent most of the time feeding in place. Females fed 50% faster than males and spent more time feeding. U. vocans was the dominant species at the beach in silty sand and was very active. Its feeding rate was about twice that of the former species, females fed more rapidly than males, and many crabs of both sexes fed in droves at the water's edge during ebb tides. During ebb tides, they spent most of their time feeding, while at flood tide they engaged in a greater variety of activities, including burrow maintenance. They frequently walked while feeding and interacted aggressively. U. tetragonon lived in a pebbly band along one edge of the beach, by a quay. Their feeding rate was comparable in both sexes and slower than that of U. vocans; they fed largely on filamentous algae growing on the quay, which provides better food, and fed faster during flood tide than ebb tide. They spent more time in waving and other sex-related activities, and were seldom aggressive, except during the week of the full moon. Burrowing activities included placing excavated mud balls some distance away from their burrows and rearranging them. U. dussumieri inhabited the other end of the beach in muddier substrate. They did not have sex differences in feeding rates and their rate of scooping food into their mouths was slow, but feeding claws made multiple pinches of the substrate, thus accumulating more material in each clawful of food.

AB  - The effects of chromated copper arsenate (CCA), used for treating wood in docks, pilings, and bulkheads, were studied in several estuarine organisms. Leaching of metals from treated wood into sea water was assayed by atomic absorption spectrophotmetry.

Fiddler crabs (Uca pugilator) were subjected to limb removal and were placed in containers with treated wood of various sizes or control wood. Limb regeneration rate was retarded in a dose-dependent fashion and mortality occurred with the treated wood, reaching 100% in the tank with the larges piece of wood.

Embryos of the mummichog (Fundulus heteroclitus) were allowed to develop in culture dishes in which CCA-treated or untreated wood was soaking. Mortality was noted in the dishes with treated wood and to a smaller extent in those with untreated wood.

Containers containing CCA-treated wood, control wood, or no wood were stocked first with the alga Ulva lactuca, then snails (Nassarius obsoletus). Chlorophyll content of the algae was reduced with the treated wood within a few days, and snails with the treated wood became moribund and died within a few days. In the controls containing untreated wood or no wood, no such effects were seen. Studies with individual or combinations of two or three of the metals with snails and algae indicated that the copper was primarily responsible for the snail mortality and algal bleaching seen in the treated wood experiments. In all experiments, the toxicity of the wood decreased over time; when the experiments were repeated with the same pieces of wood, effects were diminished.

AB  - Previous studies have demonstrated leaching from chromated-copper-arsenate (CCA)-treated wood, which is used in pilings and bulkheads, and resulting toxicity to various estuarine organisms. The current study compared effects of leachates from CCA-treated wood with those of recycled plastic "lumber," a possible alternative construction material. Limb regeneration in fiddler crabs, while depressed in leachates from CCA wood, was accelerated in three formulations of recycled plastics. The acceleration was reduced in subsequent trials with the same pieces of plastic. Using a sea urchin fertilization test, no effects were seen in 1- and 3-day leachates from the plastics. However, CCA wood reduced fertilization by 90%, and totally inhibited larval development of those that did fertilize. A smaller piece of wood, one-tenth the size (0.4 cm2) , did not have a significant effect on fertilization or development. With 1-3 weeks of leaching, significant reductions in fertilization were seen in sea urchin gametes exposed to one plastic formulation and no fertilization was seen in leachates from the small piece of CCA wood. Two formulations enriched to 30% polystyrene (PS) had no significant effect on fertilization, but did reduce larval growth. When the same pieces of plastic and wood were used for a second set of experiments, all three formulations of plastic, as well as the small piece of wood, inhibited fertilization significantly, and one of the 30% PS formulations and the wood caused reduced larval growth.

In another assay, snails and an alga were exposed to plastics for two months with no observed effect; the CCA leachates caused 100% snail mortality within one week and chlorosis of the alga. Chemical analysis by GC/MS revealed a large number of chemicals leached in various quantities from the plastic.

AB  - The food conversion efficiency of F. heteroclitus (L.) was measured in terms of calories and N for 3 diets: Palaemonetes sp., Nereis sp. and Uca pugnax. Fish were allowed to feed ad lib for 30-60 min each day. Growth, ingestion, egestion and excretion were measured for fish fed each diet. The growth rates of F. heteroclitus fed 2 of the single item diets of invertebrates were higher than growth rates previously estimated for mummichogs from the natural population in Canary Creek marsh [Delaware, USA]. In comparison with other fish species, F. heteroclitus had a higher than average assimilation efficiency (.hivin.X [mean] = 87% for all 3 diets) and a lower than average gross growth efficiency (.apprxeq. 12% for 2 of the diets). Metabolic costs accounted for an average of 69% of ingested energy. Excretion rates were also large, with excretion accounting for more energy than egestion in 2 of the 3 diets.

AB  - Male and female Uca were video-taped feeding on patches of diatom Cylindrotheca closterium. Using fluorometric analysis of chlorophyll, experiments showed males and females had different intake rates, and that the sexes differed in the relationship between intake rate and food level. Females had higher intake rates than males, but the ratio of female:male intake rate varied with food level, being greater at low levels. Intake rate remains constant past a certain sex-specific food abundance, regardless of further increases in resource levels.

Intake rate was a product of the rate at which food was transferred to the mouth (scoop rate), and the rate at which food was extracted by the mouthparts. Scoop rate increased with food level, and extraction decreased exponentially with decreased processing time. Females had higher scoop rates at equivalent food levels, and higher extraction rates at equal processing times. High scoop rates mean small processing times, so extraction declines with feeding rate, producing static intake rate at high food concentration.

The above differences among the sexes have behavioral and morphological consequences. Males displace females from high quality patches, which compensates for their lower intake rates. Females have more setae than males, allowing them to sustain higher extraction rates. It was suggested that the male master claw evolved through ecological divergence, rather than sexual selection.

The energetic cost of foraging was estimated by measuring both O$\sb2$ depletion and food consumed during foraging. An energetic model was developed giving the net energetic intake (NEI) vs food consumed, for males, females, and males where intake rate was experimentally decreased (altered males). The model gave the threshold at which animals should leave a patch to maximize energetic intake. Females experienced the greatest NEI, followed by males, followed by altered males. Females were predicted to leave a patch later than males, which should leave later than altered males. The model was shown to be insensitive to changes in the cost parameters.

Animals used their predicted leaving rule, maximizing patch-specific NEI. Comparison of altered and normal males showed that the leaving rule was not fixed, but based on direct assessment of intake rate.

AB  - Intake rate (mu-g Chl a.g-1 sediment dry weight.s-1), scoop rate (feeding motions.s-1 of the feeding chelae) and extraction rate (mu-g Chl a removed.g-1 sediment dry wt.s-1) were characterized for male and female fiddler crabs Uca pugnax (Smith) feeding on patches of diatoms in the laboratory. Female intake rate remained constant on patches with Chl a concentrations ranging from 50 to 200-mu-g Chl a.g-1 sediment dry wt, whereas male intake rate increased between 50 and 100-mu-g.g-1 Chl a, and plateaus at a food level of 200-mu-g Chl a.g-1. The ratio of female: male intake rate declined from a value of 2.3 at 50-mu-g Chl a.g-1, to almost-equal-to 1.3 at 200-mu-g.g-1. These patterns were the result of sex-specific patterns in scoop and extraction rates vs. food concentration. Scoop rate increased with food concentration, but the extraction rate fell as individuals fed more quickly, and extraction became time limited. Females exhibited higher overall scoop rates than males, and maintained higher per chelae scoop rates except at very low food concentrations. Females also had higher extraction rates at equivalent feeding rates. In general, because of their more rapid feeding, females were always extraction-time limited, whereas males were scoop rate limited at low food levels, and extraction-time limited at high food levels. These results illustrate the danger of extrapolating intake rate from scoop (feeding) rate, as there was a nonlinear relationship between the two. In addition, the cost of the male master chelae in terms of decreased intake rate is not constant, but varies with food concentration. The overall decrease in male fitness due to this feeding cost is therefore dependent on the distribution of food abundance in the habitat.

AB  - The energy costs and benefits of foraging were quantified for male and female fiddler crabs. Benefits accrued during foraging were calculated using patch-specific intake rates, combined with an analysis of the energy value of the food. Foraging costs per unit time were quantified by measuring O2 depletion of foraging animals. An energetics model constructed with these cost-benefit functions predicted the leaving rule, defined as the food concentration at which a crab should cease feeding in a patch, that maximized energy intake. A second model was designed for males feeding on fine (sieved) sediments, which reduced intake rate, and therefore changed foraging costs. Lastly, by building on a previous analysis of foraging mechanics, the model examined whether the structure of the foraging system constrains the ability of fiddler crabs to maximize energy intake. Analysis of sex-specific intake rates and foraging costs indicates that females, although experiencing greater costs, also had higher intake rates, than males. The model predicted that females should acquire more energy from foraging in a patch, and should display a lower leaving threshold than males. The leaving rule prediction was tested and confirmed; observed leaving thresholds for all three treatments (females, males, and males on fine sediments) were statistically indistinguishable from model predictions. As predicted by the model, males feeding on fine sediments responded to increased costs by displaying a higher leaving threshold, relative to males on unsieved sediments. A sensitivity analysis, performed by using the 95% confidence interval of O2 consumption to bracket foraging costs, indicated the model to be robust; leaving thresholds were extremely stable, with all three predicted thresholds remaining quite distinct, despite a 20% change in the cost function. Finally, the model showed that the architecture of the feeding system constrains the ability to implement energy maximizing strategies. Constraints are gender specific, and the associated energy penalty is frequently small.

AB  - Chemosensory neurons of female fiddler crabs (genus Uca) display greater sensitivity to mixtures of food-related stimuli than do neurons in males. This phenomenon represents an interesting contrast to other sex-specific systems, which tend to be in response to cues associated with mating and parental care. This study examined the responses of chemosensory neurons in males and females to ten individual stimuli to determine if sex-specific responses were restricted to a few key compounds, or if the heightened sensitivity of females was broadly distributed. Neurons in males and females responded well to all stimuli, and although fiddler crabs are primarily herbivorous, highly efficacious physiological stimulants included amino acids and amines as well as carbohydrates most closely associated with plant material. The chemosensory neurons are characterized by broad tuning and relatively high response thresholds, when compared to other crustaceans. Most importantly, the investigations revealed a robust pattern in which female neurons displayed elevated responses to all stimuli. Tuning breadth was not shown to be sex-specific, nor were there detectable differences in over-all response profiles. The most likely explanation for these patterns is that the broad sex-specificity in Uca is produced via fundamental alterations in cellular properties associated with chemosensory transduction.

AB  - Fiddler crabs exhibit sex-specific chemosensitivity to a battery of ecologically relevant stimuli. To uncover the cellular basis of this dimorphism, a series of experiments were designed to identify the second messenger systems that mediate chemosensory transduction, and determine if these systems display differences in males and females. The activity of single chemoreceptor cells was monitored extracellularly. For several different stimuli, the phosphodiesterase inhibitors IBMX and Ro 20-1724, and the AC activator forskolin result in decreased sensitivity when co-presented with odorants, suggesting that the AC-cAMP cascade mediates inhibitory transduction. The degree of reduction was dose dependent and reversible, with a reduction in activity ranging from 90-40% of control levels. Forskolin and Ro produced a significantly greater reduction in activity than IBMX. For all cases the response decrement in females was less than that observed in males, indicating that the activity of the AC-cAMP system is elevated in males, either via enhancement of cAMP production or retardation of cAMP degradation in males relative to females. The effect of IBMX and forskolin combined was no greater than that of forskolin alone, suggesting that rates of cAMP production are responsible. Cross talk between excitatory and inhibitory cascades also may be a factor in differences in the level of cAMP in male and female neurons, and experiments examining this possibility will be presented. These results directly implicate differential activity of second messenger systems in the expression of behavioral differences, indicating behavioral ecology may be explored by analysis of sensory transduction.

AB  - Fiddler crabs (Uca spp.) exhibit sex-specific responses food- related chemical cues, constituting a natural experiment regarding the regulation of chemosensitivity. To understand the mechanisms that underlie these broad differences, chemosensory neurons from the claws were challenged with stimulants in the presence of various agents that activate or inhibit the adenylate cyclase-cAMP transduction cascade. Stimulants mixed with agents that increase intracellular cAMP (forskolin, 3- isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, and Ro 20-1724) elicited decreased response magnitudes from neurons, compared to drug-free controls, whereas the adenylate cyclase inhibitor SQ 22536 increased the response. These effects were dose dependent and reversible, and, in all cases, were more dramatic in male than in female neurons. Similar to other crustaceans, the adenylate cyclase-cAMP second-messenger system appears to regulate inhibition in fiddler crab chemosensory neurons. The perturbations of this pathway reveal that the degree of inhibition is greater in male than in female neurons, consistent with the lower behavioral and physiological sensitivity typically displayed by males. Changes in the expression of the second messenger system may be causal in the production of sex-specific patterns of chemosensitivity that underlie behavior. Alternately, experimental perturbations using adenylate cyclase-cAMP pathway modulators may unmask sex- specific differences in electrical properties of peripheral neurons affecting action potential generation.

AB  - This study examined properties of chemoreceptor neurons in the claws and legs of the fiddler crabs Uca pugilator and U. pugnax. The primary goal was to establish the neural basis of previously observed greater female sensitivity to feeding stimulants, and secondarily to compare physiological properties of chemoreceptor neurons in these semi-terrestrial crustaceans with those of fully aquatic forms. Sensitivity of chemoreceptor neurons in claws and legs is sex-specific; individual neurons of females respond to lower stimulus concentrations than male chemoreceptor neurons, and equivalent concentrations elicit greater spiking in female vs male chemoreceptor neurons. Thus, the population of chemoreceptor neurons in females expresses lower thresholds and greater average sensitivity than in males. Greater sensitivity of claw neurons explains observations indicating that females continue to feed at food levels too low to stimulate males. Sensitivity differences in leg neurons of males vs females have no clear behavioral correlate, but suggest that females can orient to more dilute stimuli than males. Chemoreceptor neurons of fiddler crabs have low sensitivities and slow rates of adaptation compared to other crustaceans. Also, neurons in claws adapt less slowly than neurons in legs, which may reflect subtle difference's in the chemical stimulus environment experienced by claws vs legs.

AB  - We used transsexual limb transplants in fiddler crabs to examine how peripheral sensory structures interact with the central nervous system (CNS) to produce a sexually dimorphic behavior. Female and male chemosensory feeding claws were transplanted onto male hosts in place of nonfeeding, nonchemosensory claws. Successfully transplanted claws retain donor morphologies and contain chemosensory neurons. Neurons in successfully transplanted female feeding claws express the enhanced sensitivity to chemical cues seen in female, but not male, neurons in claws of normal animals. When chemically stimulated, the transplanted claws evoke feeding behavior not observed in normal males, even though the sensory neurons in the transplanted limb project to the host's sexually dimorphic neuropil not known to receive chemosensory input. Behavioral sensitivity is directly related to the sensitivity of peripheral neurons in the transplanted feeding claw. Thus, the interactions between peripheral neurons and their targets may restructure the CNS so that novel sensory capabilities are expressed, and this can produce sexually dimorphic behaviors.

AB  - The organization of sensory nerves and sensilla was examined in the feeding claw of two species of fiddler crabs, Uca pugnax and U. pugilator, using neuroanatomical and behavioral techniques. Surveys of the populations of axons indicate that claws of adult crabs contain 25000-40000 neurons. Approximately 85% of the population consists of axons with diameters less than 1 mu m, suggesting they may represent chemosensory neurons. Females show an enhanced population of these small (putative chemosensory) axons relative to males, providing a mechanism to explain previously observed sexual differences in behavioral chemosensitivity to feeding stimulants. Surveys of the claw surface show a variety of external structures that could contain either chemo- or mechanosensory receptor neurons. There are hair-like sensilla of several types, some of which are more abundant in females than in males. In addition, claws show previously undescribed pit sensilla reminiscent of known bimodal chemo- and mechanosensory sensilla found in certain decapod crustaceans. Morphological properties of hair-like sensilla, as well as their small number in relation to the large population of presumptive chemosensory axons, suggest that they have a limited role in chemosensation. Most of the chemosensory axons probably originate in the pit sensilla.

AB  - Fiddler crab (Uca longisignalis) first stage zoea and adults were assayed for behavioral responses to 16 amino acids and sugars. Larval chemosensitivity was examined using computer-video motion analysis of swimming behavior. Adult sensitivity was assayed by determining the substances that elicit feeding. The pattern of chemoreception expressed by U. longisignalis adults is strongly correlated with that measured previously in adult sand fiddler crabs, Uca pugilator. This concordance among abilities probably reflects shared trophic ecologies of the two species. In contrast, a quantitative analysis shows no significant correlation between the sets of compounds inducing chemoreceptive behavior by larval and adult U. longisignalis. The strongest responses (by both stages) are elicited by substances found in potential prey, and differences in prey types among larvae and adults appear responsible for the lack of correlation. Larvae do, however, respond to substances abundant in prey consumed by adults, even though these substances are absent, or occur at low levels, in larval prey. Adults, on the other hand, appear insensitive to compounds that cue only larval food, but which are maximally stimulatory to larvae. Consequently, our results indicate that the abilities of one life-history stage may be constrained, through development, by the requirements of later stages. The patterns of correlation among adults of different species, and among life-history stages within a species, indicate that both ecological context and developmental factors influence patterns of chemosensitivity.

AB  - Settlement of blue crab Callinectes sapidus Rathbun postlarvae (megalopae) was examined in the field in the presence and absence of chemical cues from settlement habitats and potential megalopal predators. Megalopae in premolt preferentially settled on collectors containing seagrasses Zostera marina and Halodule wrightii, but not on collectors with salt marsh cordgrass Spartina alterniflora. Settlement of megalopae was reduced by up to 40% in the presence of predators from several different habitats, including crabs Uca pugilator, U. pugnax and Panopeus herbstii, and grass shrimp Palaemonetes pugio. Laboratory predation assays showed that each of these potential predators ate C. sapidus megalopae if they encountered them. Megalopae avoided odors of U, pugilator in chemotaxis assays, and showed no reaction to odors from Z, marina and S, alterniflora. Settlement of megalopae was unaffected by the presence of adult C. sapidus or brown shrimp Penaeus aztecus, neither of which consumed megalopae in laboratory predation assays. Megalopae showed no reaction to fouled shells of oyster Crassostrea virginica, but avoided live C, virginica. Thus, settling blue crab megalopae can distinguish among settlement sites using chemical cues, and their discrimination ability increases in the premolt stage.

AB  - Gap succession is a significant determinant of structure and development in most forest communities. Lightning strikes are an important source of canopy gaps in the mangrove forest of Everglades National Park. I investigated the successional dynamics of lightning-initiated canopy gaps to determine their influence on forest stand structure of the mixed mangrove forests ( Rhizophora mangle, Laguncularia racemosa , and Avicennia germinans ) of the Shark River. I measured gap size, gap shape, light environment, soil characteristics, woody debris, and fiddler crab abundance. I additionally measured the vegetative composition in a chronosequences of gap successional stages (new, recruiting, and growing gaps). I recorded survivorship, recruitment, growth and soil elevation dynamics within a subset of new and growing gaps. I determined the relationship between intact forest soil elevation and site hydrology in order to interpret the effects of lightning disturbance on soil elevation dynamics. Gap size averaged 289 ± 20 m2 (± 1SE) and light transmittance decreased exponentially as gaps filled with saplings. Fine woody debris was highest in recruiting gaps. Soil strength was lower in the gaps than in the forest. The abundance of large and medium fiddler crab burrows increased linearly with total seedling abundance. Soil surface elevation declined in newly formed lightning gaps; this loss was due to a combination of superficial erosion (8.5 mm) and subsidence (60.9 mm). A distinct two-cohort recruitment pattern was evident in the seedling/sapling surveys, suggesting a partitioning of the succession between individuals present before and after lightning strike. In new gaps, the seedling recruitment rate was twice as high as in forest and the sapling population increased. At the growing gap stage, R. mangle seedling mortality was 10 times greater and sapling mortality was 13 times greater than recruitment. Growing gaps had reduced seedling stem elongation, sapling growth and adult growth. However, a few individuals (R. mangle saplings) were able to recruit into the adult life stage. In conclusion, the high density of R. mangle seedlings and saplings imply that lightning strike disturbances in these mangrove forests favor their recruitment over that of A. germinans and L. racemosa .

AB  - Wheeler Marsh in Milford, Connecticut provides habitat for diamondback terrapins (Malaclemys terrapin), a unique estuarine turtle. To assess potential prey availability, the distribution and abundances of marsh snails (Melampus bidentatus), mud snails (Ilyanassa obsoleta), marsh mussels (Geukensia demissa), and fiddler crabs (Uca spp.) were studied in several subhabitats (marsh surface, marsh edge, creek bank, and mudflats) of five tidal creeks. Almost all terrapins have been found in one section of the marsh, Turtle Creek, where all four prey species were present in large numbers. However, high numbers of some prey were found in other sections of the marsh as well, suggesting that resource availability may not be the primary determinant of terrapin distribution. The physical structure, plant density, and tidal amplitudes of salt marsh creeks may also be important determinants of terrapin distribution via their influence on resource accessibility.

AB  - This project examines the relative importance of biological and physical factors in the microhabitat use and distribution of four species of crabs in mangrove forests in south Florida. Three aspects were experimentally investigated: (1) Estimation of risk of predation among microhabitats in the mangrove on a tidal, seasonal, and annual basis. (2) Evaluation of competitive interactions for refuges. (3) Definition of suitable physiological microhabitats and measurement of responses to exposure in microhabitats in the field.

Mangrove forests are intertidal soft-sediment habitats in which the influence of physical and biological factors on the distribution of organisms may be investigated. Four species of mangrove crabs broadly overlap in habitat use and share periodic shifts in microhabitat locations. Aratus pisonii is an arboreal crab. Eurytium limosum, Sesarma curacaoense, and Uca thayeri live in burrows and holes on the mud surface and occasionally climb mangrove prop roots. Field experiments show that there is a differential risk of predation among microhabitats at low and high tides and that a change in predation intensity and predator type results in strong tidal and seasonal components of refuges. Competition for refuges does not seem to be an important factor at field population levels. In the laboratory, species differ in their response to temperature/humidity regimes. All crabs select higher relative humidities on a laboratory humidity gradient. In field experiments that tested tolerance to exposure in microhabitats, species show strong differential responses to conditions in each microhabitat.

The differential physiological suitability of refuges and risk of predation among microhabitats means that crabs must balance the constraints of physiological tolerances with the avoidance of predation in a system that carries a variable risk of predation among locations and time periods. Thus, there is a complex interaction between predation and physiological factors and no single factor can be labeled as the cause of distributional patterns.

AB  - For an intertidal organism, the ocean’s ebb and flood are major factors controlling behavior. Along the southeast coast of the United States, there are four kinds of tide habitats or regimens: strictly semidiurnal; mixed-mainly semidiurnal, mixed mainly diurnal, and strictly diurnal. Does the local tide pattern determine the properties of the endogenous biological rhythm expressed by an organism? The locomotor behaviors of the fiddler crabs U. pugilator and U. minax from the Atlantic and the Gulf coasts were studied in the laboratory. After the crabs were placed in actographs, their locomotor activity was recorded in the absence of daily and tidal “zeitgebers”. The activity data was analyzed quantitatively using periodogram analysis to estimate the period length of significant rhythms. Under LL, a significant percentage of both species from the semidiurnal habitat in the Atlantic exhibit daily (12/24h), tidal (12.4h) and circalunidian (24.8h) rhythms. On the other hand, Gulf populations where strictly diurnal tides occur, the crabs were found to have a lower percent rhythmicity. In LD, Uca express a high percent rhythmicity regardless of habitat. However, tidal periods in general are missing from the actograms of the Gulf species. We conclude that daily, tidal and circalunidian rhythms are important for population of crabs from semidiurnal tidal habitats along the Atlantic. Along the northern Gulf where strictly diurnal tides occur, daily (12/24h) and circalunidian (24.8h) are more prominent in these species than tidal (12.4h) rhythms.

We conclude that daily, tidal and circalunidian rhythms are important for population of crabs from semidiurnal tidal habitats along the Atlantic. Along the northern Gulf where strictly diurnal tides occur, daily (12/24h) and circalunidian (24.8h) are more prominent in these species than tidal (12.4h) rhythms.

AB  - Kumamolisin-As (previously called ScpA) is the first known example of a collagenase from the sedolisin family (MEROPS S53). This enzyme is active at low pH and in elevated temperatures. In this study that used x-ray crystallographic and biochemical methods, we investigated the structural basis of the preference of this enzyme for collagen and the importance of a glutamate residue in the unique catalytic triad (Ser(278)-Glu(78)-Asp(82)) for enzymatic activity. Crystal structures of the uninhibited enzyme and its complex with a covalently bound inhibitor, N-acetyl-isoleucyl-prolyl-phenylalaninal, showed the occurrence of a narrow S2 pocket and a groove that encompasses the active site and is rich in negative charges. Limited endoproteolysis studies of bovine type-I collagen as well as kinetic studies using peptide libraries randomized at P1 and P1', showed very strong preference for arginine at the P1 position, which correlated very well with the presence of a negatively charged residue in the S1 pocket of the enzyme. All of these features, together with those predicted through comparisons with fiddler crab collagenase, a serine peptidase, rationalize the enzyme's preference for collagen. A comparison of the Arrhenius plots of the activities of kumamolisin-As with either collagen or peptides as substrates suggests that collagen should be relaxed before proteolysis can occur. The E78H mutant, in which the catalytic triad was engineered to resemble that of subtilisin, showed only 0.01% activity of the wild-type enzyme, and its structure revealed that Ser(278), His(78), and Asp(82) do not interact with each other; thus, the canonical catalytic triad is disrupted.

AB  - The Caete Estuary lies within the world's second largest mangrove region, 200 km south-east of the Amazon delta. It has an extension of about 220 km2 and is subjected to a considerable human impact through intensive harvest of mangrove crabs (Ucides cordatus) and logging of mangroves. In order to integrate available information on biomass, catches, food spectrum and dynamics of the main species populations of the system, a trophic steady state model of 19 compartments was constructed using the ECOPATH II software (Christensen & Pauly, 1992). Ninety-nine percent of total system biomass is made up by mangroves (Rhizophora mangle, Avicennia germinans and Laguncularia racemosa), which are assumed to cover about 45% of the total area and contribute about 60% to the system's primary production. The remaining biomass (132 g m-2) is distributed between the pelagic and benthic domains in proportions of 10% and 90% respectively. Through litter fall, mangroves inject the main primary food source into the system, which is either consumed directly by herbivores (principally land crabs, Ucides cordatus) or, when already metabolized by bacteria, by detritivors (principally fiddler crabs, Uca spp.). These two groups are prominent in terms of biomass (80 g and 14.5 g m-2), and food intake (1120 g m-2 yr-1 and 1378 g m-2 yr-1 respectively). According to the model estimates, energy flow through the fish and shrimp compartments is of relatively low importance for the energy cycling within the system, a finding which is contrary to the situation in other mangrove estuaries reported in the literature. The dominance of mangrove epibenthos is attributed to the fact that a large part of the system's production remains within the mangrove forest as material export to the estuary is restricted to spring tides, when the forest is completely indundated.

AB  - Burrowing activities of the only European fiddler crab, Uca tangeri, and its resulting influence on biotope in mudflats were investigated during 1989-1990 at Ria Formosa, Portugal. Individuals use the same burrow for ca 1 wk, then occupy another or dig a new one. Overall a burrow is inhabited for ca 3 mo by several individuals before it is abandoned. Vacated burrows decay within 2 to 3 wk. Burrow size and number vary with the season. Burrow density was highest in spring and early summer with ca 17 burrows m-2, and then decreased. Deepest burrows (up to 90 cm long) were found in winter, the shallowest (up to 40 cm long) in summer. Volume of the sediment moved by U tangeri varied monthly between 3000 and 6000 cm3 per m2 of mudflat. Water is only found in the lower third of the burrow. Burrow water contains less oxygen and more nitrate than the surrounding water of the Ria Formosa.

AB  - The quality of the food, especially origin and size, of the only European fiddler crab, Uca tangeri (Eydoux, 1835), was studied over a 2 yr period. In experiments with fluorescent microparticles, all particles smaller than 250 mum were ingested regardless of their chemical composition. Comparisons of sediment, feeding pellets and faeces showed that U. tangeri feeds primarily on microalgae which are completely extracted from the sediment. It also consumes vascular macrophytes (Arthrocnemum spp.), macroalgae, detritus and fish carcasses.

AB  - The annual and tidal cycle of behaviour of Uca tangeri (Eydoux, 1835) was studied over a 2 yr period in the Ria Formosa on the Portuguese Algarve coast. U. tangeri settles on the mudflats as well as in the nearby zone of Arthrocnemum spp.. Individuals smaller than 27 mm carapace width live close to the creek; larger crabs inhabit the salt marsh zone. Newly settled crabs are found in the middle of the mudflat. A surface temperature of at least 18-degrees-C is necessary for U tangeri to become active on the sediment surface. Hence activity shows a clear annual cycle: the months March to July are used for courtship and reproduction. During this time crabs change colour from brown to orange and purple. Large migrations to other mudflats take place from August to October, whereas crabs stay inside their burrows from November to March. During low-tide periods, crab activity can be differentiated into food uptake, courtship, or migration and burrowing.

AB  - Prey require information if they are to respond to predation threat in a risk-sensitive manner. One way that individuals can obtain this information is through the predator-mediated, threat-induced behavior of conspecifics. We examined such a possibility in a refuge-seeking species, the sand fiddler crab (Uca pugilator). Crabs were either exposed directly to a simulated predation threat (a moving cylinder) or the threat-induced response of a near neighbor. We found that fiddler crabs responded to the flight of their neighbors even when they, themselves, were not privy to the stimulus that induced their neighbor's response. However, the wider range of behaviors exhibited by these crabs-which included no reaction, freezing, running back to the burrow entrance, and burrow retreat-suggest that 'non-threatened' crabs either (1) perceived the gravity of the predation threat differently from their directly threatened neighbors and/or (2) engaged in behaviors that allowed them to acquire further information in the face of uncertainty. Conspecific behaviors also had an effect on the hiding duration of crabs, with individuals hiding longer if they saw both the predation threat and the flight of their neighbor. Our results suggest that cues provided by conspecifics can play an important role in guiding the antipredator response of refuge-seeking prey.

AB  - Ecdysteroid hormones regulate growth, metamorphic differentiation, vitellogenesis, and oogenesis in insects. In crustaceans, molt, limb regeneration, and reproduction are closely related to ecdysteroid titers. In the fiddler crab, Uca pugilator , limb regeneration is coordinated with the molt cycle. Both limb regeneration and molting correlate with the fluctuation of circulating ecdysteroid titers. The actions of ecdysteroids are mediated through a nuclear receptor (NR), the ecdysteroid receptor (EcR). EcR needs to dimerize with another nuclear receptor, the insect ultraspiracle (USP) protein, or its vertebrate homolog, retinoid X receptor (RXR), to form a functional receptor dimer. A functional EcR/USP(RXR) heterodimer regulates gene expression by binding to a specific DNA sequence in the promoter region, the ecdysteroid hormone responsive element (HRE), or EcRE. Both EcR and USP/RXR can exist as multiple forms with variant amino acid (aa) sequences, or isoforms. Most characterized insect EcRs and USPs have amino-terminal (N-terminal) variant isoforms. Studies in insects and vertebrates show that specific NR isoforms exhibit tissue and cell type specific expression, suggesting receptor isoform specific physiological function. EcR and RXR gene homologs in U. pugilator ( UpEcR and UpRXR ) have been previously cloned. Library screenings recovered cDNA clones containing a unique amino terminal open-reading frame (A/B domain) for each gene, most similar to insect EcR-B1 and USP1/RXR isoforms. Several UpRXR cDNA splicing variants, however, are found in coding regions that could potentially influence function. A five-aa insertion/deletion is located in the "T" box in the hinge region. Another 33-aa insertion/deletion is found inside the ligand-binding domain (LBD), between helix 1 and helix 3. All these UpRXR mRNA variants are expressed in regenerating limb buds, and the predominant mRNA isoform represents the UpRXR(-5+33) isoform. Initial physical characterization of E. coli and in vitro synthesized UpEcR and UpRXR(-5+33) suggest that these crab receptors, just like insect EcR and USP/RXR, are able to heterodimerize.

AB  - We are examining the roles of steroids, retinoids and their nuclear receptors (NRs) in the proliferation, differentiation and growth events accompanying the crustacean molt cycle and limb regeneration. We have isolated fiddler crab cDNA clones encoding homologs of the ecdysteroid (UpEcR) and retinoid-X (UpRXR) classes of NR. These genes represent the functional ecdysone receptor in insects. The poorly conserved A/B domains of NRs are involved in ligand-independent transactivation. In many insects, isoforms for both the EcR and RXR/USP proteins have been identified; these isoforms arise from the splicing of alternative A/B domains onto common DNA-binding and ligand-binding domains. Studies in insects strongly suggest that these isoforms have different physiological roles. Analyses of the recovered crab UpEcR and UpRXR clones, however, reveal a unique (i.e. invariant) A/B domain open-reading frame for each gene, showing greatest similarities to the Tenebrio EcR B1 and the Manduca USP-1 isoforms, respectively. We are examining A/B: common domain transcript ratios by PCR and RPA, to assess for the presence of other A/B isoforms.

AB  - Several UpRXR cDNA variants were found in regions that could potentially influence function. A 5 aa insertion/ deletion is located in the "T" box in the D domain. Another 33 aa insertion/deletion is found inside the ligand binding domain, between helix 1 and helix 3. Expression vectors for these UpRXR variants and UpEcR were constructed, and proteins expressed in E.coli and in vitro TNT expression systems. The expressed crab nuclear receptors were then characterized by EMSA and GST-pull down experiments. The pull-down results show UpEcR interactions with those UpRXR variants that have the 33 aa insertion, but not with those lacking the 33 aa insertion. Although weak UpRXR protein-protein binding is observed, only pairing between -33 and +33 UpRXR LBD domains results in a pull-down. EMSA results show that UpEcR/UpRXR heterocomplexes bind with a IRper-1 hormone responsive element only if UpRXR contains the 33 aa insertion. UpRXR lacking both the 5 aa and 33 aa insertion however, is found to bind a DR-1 HRE as a homocomplex. These in vitro protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions are hormone (20-hydroxy-ecdysone and 9-cis-retinoid acid) independent. Temporal and spatial distribution of UpEcR and UpRXR were studied by immunohistochemical analysis. Polyclonal antibodies against E.coli expressed A/B domain and common domain proteins of UpEcR and UpRXR were applied to limb sections throughout the regeneration cycle. A large group of tissues and cell populations are immuno-reactive to UpEcR and UpRXR antibodies. The immuno-reactive patterns suggest that UpEcR and UpRXR are often co-localized.

AB  - When injured, the fiddler crab Uca pugilator can reflexively cast off a damaged limb at a predetermined site proximal to the injury. This reflex severs the damaged limb adjacent to the body wall, between the basiioschiopodite and coxa. Autotomy, therefore, normally leads to the loss of all limb segments. Normal regeneration of autotomized limbs accompanies the animal's molt cycle, and newly formed limbs emerge as the animal undergoes ecdysis. Under laboratory conditions, however, another kind of limb regeneration was observed that was not associated with autotomy. Newly molted crabs were found to regenerate amputated limbs without the loss of all segments distal to the coxa. Regeneration occurred normally at every amputation site tested, including cuts at the propus, carpus and merus. Only the missing structures were regenerated, with appropriate proximal-distal segmentation. Newly regenerated limbs grow from the amputation site and complete limbs emerge at ecdysis similar to normal autotomy-associated limb regeneration. This observation indicates that cells capable of regeneration can be recruited all along the limb axis, and that signaling mechanisms exist for appropriate tissue specification.

AB  - We have identified cDNA clones that encode homologs of the ecdysteroid receptor (EcR) and retinoid-X receptor (RXR)/USP classes of nuclear receptors from the fiddler crab Uca pugilator (UpEcR and UpRXR). Several UpRXR cDNA splicing variants were found in coding regions that could potentially influence function. A five-amino acid (aa) insertion/deletion is located in the "T" box in the hinge region. Another 33-aa insertion/deletion is found inside the ligand-binding domain (LBD), between helix 1 and helix 3. Ribonuclease protection assays (RPA) showed that four UpRXR transcripts [UpRXR(+5+33), UpRXR(-5+33), UpRXR(+5-33) and UpRXR(-5-33)] were present in regenerating limb buds. UpRXR(-5+33) was the most abundant transcript present in regenerating limb buds in both early blastema and late premolt growth stages. Expression vectors for these UpRXR variants and UpEcR were constructed, and the proteins expressed in E. coli and in vitro expression systems. The expressed crab nuclear receptors were then characterized by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull down experiments. EMSA results showed that UpEcR/UpRXR(-5+33) heterocomplexes bound with a series of hormone response elements (HREs) including eip28/29, IRper-1, DR-4, and IRhsp-1 with appreciable affinity. Competition EMSA also showed that the affinity decreased as sequence composition deviated from a perfect consensus element. Binding to IRper-1 HREs occurred only if the heterodimer partner UpRXR contained the 33-aa LBD insertion. UpRXR lacking both the 5-aa and 33-aa insertion bound to a DR-1G HRE in the absence of UpEcR. The results of GST-pull down experiments showed that UpEcR interacted only with UpRXR variants containing the 33-aa insertion, and not with those lacking the 33-aa insertion. These in vitro receptor protein-DNA and receptor protein-protein interactions occurred in the absence of hormone (20-hydroxyecdysone and 9-cis refinoid acid, 9-cis RA). Transactivation studies using a hybrid UpEcR ligand-binding domain construct and UpRXR ( 33) ligand-binding domain constructs also showed that the 33-aa insertion was indispensable in mediating ecdysteroid stimulated transactivation.

AB  - On the jiangsu coast, eastern China, Spartina alterniflora, which was introduced artificially into the region, is becoming a dominant plant species in the inter-tidal salt marshes. In order to evaluate the environmental and ecological impact of the colonization of S. alterniflora, we carried out investigations into the benthic macrofauna of the Spartina marshes of the Wanggang area. central Jiangsu coast, in 2006 and 2007. Based on analysis of the data sets obtained, 12 species of macrobenthos have been identified for the Wanggang salt marsh, including S. alterniflora, Cerithidea cingulata, Littorna scabra, Bithynia fuchsiana, Macrophthalmus japonicus, Uca arcuata, Nereis sp., Boleophthalmus petinirostris, Cyclina sinensis, Bullacta exarata, Angustassiminea castanea and Glaucomya chinensis. The results indicate that some of the native species have adapted to the new ecological environment associated with the cordgrass S. atterniflora. The biomass of macrobenthos varies significantly over different parts of the salt marsh. Further, there is a seasonal change in bio-density, with the density in summer (July and August) > autumn (November) > early summer (May). At the landward edge and over the central part of the S. atterniflora marsh, the bio-diversity is higher than the other areas of the marsh. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - A total of 205 Uca lactea females, which were reared in the laboratory for more than two months without the presence of males, were used to determine if crabs copulate in males' burrows. The females were released in the field and were enticed by courting males into their burrows. Pairs in the burrows were caught after 24 minutes or more. The occurrence of copulation in males' burrows was proven by the presence of spermatophores in the vagina. About 60% of the females were inseminated two hours after staying in males' burrows.

AB  - Ovary indices, percentage of ovigerous females and the presence of spermatophores in the vagina of females of Uca lactea, as well as the semilunar cycle of construction of the so-called "hood" by the males were examined. From these, the reproductive period of U. lactea, both in males and females, is deduced. This period starts in early June and continues to the end of August. Males have a semi-lunar cycle, but females have a lunar cycle and produce a clutch of eggs twice a year.

AB  - No significant difference was observed in the size composition of the pairs of Uca lactea mating on the surface and those mating underground. Most crabs did not select their mates by size. The fact that the size of the tips of the male pleopods and that of the female gonopores does not increase after the crabs have reached a carapace width of 14 mm, makes it possible for crabs of different sizes to copulate. Wandering females that were enticed by waving males had a well-developed ovary. However, the ovary of females that mated on the surface could be in various stages of development.

Females reared in the laboratory for 30 to 50 days under conditions isolated from the natural tidal rhythms, released larvae mostly at the time of high tide. Females did not come out of the burrow for larval release, which occurs in the burrow that is opened under water.

AB  - Seasonal change of the hepatopancreas index (H. I. = hepatopancreas dry weight / body dry weight excluding large cheliped, x 100) was examined in adult males of Uca lactea (De Haan, 1835). The average H. I. was 12.8 in a sample taken on 30 May but it dropped to 7.8 in a sample of 29 June, This drop is caused partly by the reproductive activities such as waving, but also by the moulting that occurred in June. Most copulating males, whether on the surface or underground, had a low H. I. The average H. I. of the males that copulated underground after 16 July was 5. 1. The recovery of H. I. is slow and in the sample of 6 December it was 9.2. The testis index (T. I. = testis and vas deferens dry weight / body dry weight excluding large cheliped, x 100) ranged from 0.43 to 0.70. The vas deferens contained spermatophores both during reproductive and non-reproductive periods.

AB  - Dimorphism of chelipeds due to regeneration occurs both in males and females of Uca arcuata (De Haan, 1833). After the loss of the large cheliped in males, a new large claw is regenerated at its original place, and no transformation of handedness occurs. However, the regenerated chelipeds have no distinct tooth on either the movable or immovable fingers. Females have a pair of teeth on their chelipeds but the regenerated cheliped has no teeth. Young crabs of early stages, both males and females, possess two small, symmetrical chelipeds with teeth, but regenerated chelipeds have no teeth. It is assumed that both males and females of U. arcuata have a special morphogenetic mechanism at the base of the cheliped. The mechanism starts to work after the loss of the cheliped and transforms the regenerating cheliped into the toothless type.

AB  - Three different methods were employed to estimate the annual survival rate of adult crabs, Uca lactea. A study of the number of burrows showed an average value of 70.5%. From the change of population density in a habitat, it was estimated to be 73.5% in males and 81.6% in females. A total of 499 males and 437 females were put in cages for one or two years in another habitat. The survival rates of those were 84.4% for males and 76.2% for females. No difference in survival rate by body size was encountered. The annual growth decreased with increasing crab size. The estimated CW of two- and seven-year-old males is 14.34 mm and 19.53 mm, respectively. In females, these values are 13.24 mm and 17.35 mm. From the existence of very large individuals in natural populations and the average survival rate calculated, the maximum life span is deduced to be seven years or more.

AB  - Adult females of Uca lactea were dissected and the dry weight of their hepatopancreas, ovary, and other portions of the body was measured separately. Hepatopancreas and ovary indices (H. I. and O. I., respectively) were defined as the percentage of their dry weight against that of the whole body. From the relationship equation, the dry weight of a 13 mm CW female was calculated. A large seasonal change in weight was recognized. It was high in June and low during August and October. H. I. was highest in May and lowest in August. O. I. was inversely related to H. I. and was highest by the end of June and early July. The caloric value of the body was obtained by totalling the caloric contents of hepatopancreas, ovary, and other parts of the body. The value was highest in May and lowest in August or October. The caloric value of the body of ovigerous females in August was only 52-57% of the maximum caloric content of females in May. The ovigerous females in August had a H. I. of only 2.0-3.6 and had consumed almost all the nutrients deposited in their body after the production of two clutches of eggs. They had not enough nutrients left to produce a third clutch. The caloric content of a 14 mm CW male was obtained by a similar procedure. The value was highest in May and June but no large decrease as a result of reproductive activities was found.

AB  - A fifty-fifty ratio was confirmed for the left- and right- handedness of Uca arcuata (De Haan, 1833). All young crabs below a carapace width of 3.0 mm possessed two small, equal chelipeds. Some crabs with only one cheliped and others with two large chelipeds appeared in the size range of 3.1 to 5.6 mm. The presence of two large chelipeds is transitional; one of these chelipeds is later lost. Cheliped asymmetry of males is attained by losing of one of chelipeds that regenerates into a small cheliped, and the concurrent, continuous growth of the other cheliped.

AB  - Morphological features of the minor claw and of the first and second maxillipeds of the fiddler crab, Uca arcuata were studied. Males have a claw with it longer dactylus and propodus than females, but differences are very small. No sexual difference was found in the width of claw. Males have a higher and deeper minor claw than females. There are no clear sexual differences in the numbers of hair-like setae that occur on the outer and inner surface of the minor claws. Sexual difference was observed in the length of basket setae but not in their number. No clear sexual differences were observed in the length and width of the first and second maxillipeds. The total number of setae that occur on the anterior half of the inner Surface of the second maxilliped was counted. No sexual difference was found. The total number and density of the setae that occur on the outer surface of the basal endite of the first maxilliped were examined. No clear Sexual differences were found. In the width of the third maxillipeds, we found no sexual difference, either. Our results thus suggest that no Sexual differences in the mouthparts exist yet, studies of feeding behaviour show, that females scoop 70% more frequently than males with two chelipeds, and that males collect 46% more substratum in one scoop than do females.

AB  - Adult males of Uca lactea build an earthen structure above the entrance of their burrows during the reproductive period. Most males start building from 0.5 to 2 hours after the exposure of the habitat. Males carry substratum by four walking legs of either sides but mostly by the major side for an average of 11 times. No special trend in the direction of the hoods was found. Most males reconstructed the hood when it was destroyed within 2 hours after building. The direction of the hood depends on that of the burrow, and males tend to build the hood to take the same or a similar direction as the burrow. The area surrounding a male burrow is divided into two sectors, a 180 degrees area in front of the hood and a 180 degrees area behind the hood. Males with a hood spent more than 80% of their active time in the frontal section. An area of 100 to 200 cm(2) in front of the hood was kept clean, and its male used it as a waving ground and spent much of its active time there. We suggest that the hood is useful as a signpost to show the location of the male's burrow, but it is also built to make it easier to defend the builder's burrow against wandering males.

AB  - Uca lactea (De Haan, 1835) is a stationary animal and has no habit of wandering about in its habitat. Each individual keeps an area surrounding its burrow and defends that from the invading neighbours. The peripheral portion of the territory is shared with the neighbours but the owner exclusively possesses the central area. Threat, expulsion, and fight between crabs are well ritualized. Violent fights between mates rarely occur. Males threaten or expel females by the large cheliped but feeding activities of females are little affected. Females threaten invading females and sometimes run to the opponent and kick it. No special earthen structure is built to protect the territory. Feeding crabs do not stay at the same spot but continuously change their positions, yet they remain well oriented to their burrow and run to it in a flash and then hide in it, when threatened. Crabs can walk not only sideways but also forwards or backwards, and always make use of their position directed to the entrance of the burrow. No distinct change in the size of the territory of males was observed in the reproductive period.

AB  - We report a two-fold suppression in activation energy for water loss in adult Uca minax males compared to co-occurring species, U. pugilator and U. pugnax, that overlap in salt marsh/estuary habitats, implying a water-tight cuticular modification that is unique to U. minax. This is further reflected by a drop in Arrhenius frequency (steric) factor A as an integrated measure of cuticular effectiveness. U. minax is also distinguished by an enlarged body size (approximately 5x as large as the other two species) and an enhanced capacity for water retention by a pronounced 4-5 fold decrease in net transpiration rate, presumably as a result of surface area to volume properties and the reduction in cuticular permeability. High net transpiration rates correspond to high activation energies in U. pugilator and U. pugnax, suggesting that they are more porous; the values for U. pugnax were the highest indicating that this species is the most prone to water stress. Features that these crab species have in common are a 67% body water content, twice the amount of water as their dry mass (size), and absence of a critical transition temperature (CTT) that safeguards them against an abrupt, lethal water loss. Lack of a CTT agrees with previous descriptions of crabs having no water-proofing epicuticular lipids and matches their rapid water loss rates and limitation to wet habitats. The ability by U. minax to conserve water by restricting water loss, however, makes them less dependent on a moisture-rich habitat, and this parallels field data that account for the differential capacity of U. minax to thrive in terrestrial inland locations by resisting desiccation and to survive in fresh water by being less porous to water entry. Results are consistent with the view that placing a priority on investigating what crabs are actually doing in the field (they operate on a smaller scale; i.e., microhabitat) is more important to application of net transpiration rate than as a general indicator of moisture-requirements for a species.

AB  - Adult sand fiddler crabs, Uca pugilator, forage in large herds on exposed sediment during low tide. These herds form as a response to optimal foraging conditions but may have an additional benefit of water conservation. We determined water loss rates for crabs in groups of different sizes. Crabs in groups of 10 and 20, but not in a group of 5 or isolated individuals, showed a water-conserving group effect, yielding nearly a two-fold decrease in water loss rates. Other characteristics of U. pugilator (water content, dehydration tolerance, activation energies for water loss, critical transition temperature, and critical equilibrium humidity) are consistent with a hydrophilic water balance profile. Because crabs did not replenish water supplies from water vapor like some terrestrial arthropods, water conservation is vital to crab survival outside burrows. Enhanced water retention generated by herding likely permits more time for feeding outside the burrow, while also increasing feeding efficiency by minimizing frequency of water uptake. The fact that U. pugilator is semiterrestrial suggests that a reduction in water loss due to group effects may provide a mechanism for terrestrialization.

AB  - Sand fiddler crabs. Uca pugilator. from North Carolina (NC) are two-tunes smaller than ones from Florida (FL). A water balance study was conducted to examine this size difference in relation to possible changes in habitat Suitability. Like most crabs, U. pugilator are classified as hydrophilic. which is consistent with their preference for humid environments. In contrast to the North Carolina population, U. pugilator-FL loses water less rapidly and has higher percentage body water content, a water balance strategy that emphasizes retention. Conversely. the amount of body water required is less for U. pugilator-NC, enabling it to maintain water balance despite having a higher water loss rate. Both tolerated only about 1/4 loss of body water before succumbing to desiccation. Neither experienced a critical transition temperature, CTT. We concluded that water balance profiles of these two Populations are complementary, representing trade-offs that permit survival in a moisture-rich habitat. Lower body water content. however, overlaps with features of arthropods that thrive at low temperature. suggesting that U. pugilator-NC may be more cold tolerant.

AB  - There are several ways to estimate the distance to an object based on visual information. Many robotic systems compute object distances based on disparity values or motion information. In addition to a disparity cue or image motion, research has shown that animals can possibly estimate the distance using the image size as well as the azimuth and elevation angles in their visual field. In this paper, inspired by the vigilance behavior of fiddler crabs, we suggest distance-estimation methods with several visual cues for engineering applications. A foraging fiddler crab can estimate the distance of an intruder from the burrow entrance. If the intruder is close to the burrow, the crab rushes back home to maintain possession of the burrow. In this study, we investigated burrow-centered distance-estimation methods based on visual information such as the retinal position, that is, the azimuth and elevation angles in an omnidirectional view as well as the image size and retinal speed of a target object. The methods show potential for engineering applications to the surveillance problem.

AB  - To aid in the structure-function analysis of $\alpha$-PDH (pigment-dispersing hormone from Pandalus borealis), amino-terminally truncated analogues and several peptides related to the core region were synthesized, purified to homogeneity, and assayed for bioactivity in vivo and in vitro on chromatophores of the fiddler crab Uca pugilator. In both types of assays the peptide 6-18-NH$\sb2$ was the shortest N-deletion analogue displaying bioactivity. This peptide and the core-related peptides (5-9-NH$\sb2$, 5-10-NH$\sb2$, 6-9-NH$\sb2$, and 6-10-NH$\sb2$) displayed well-defined dispersion in melanophores, but failed to trigger dose-related dispersion in leucophores in vitro. The analogue 5-18-NH$\sb2$ was effective in eliciting dose-related dispersion in leucophores and melanophores in vitro. These results indicate that, although the residues 6-9 may serve as the minimal sequence for melanophore activation, the sequence 5-9 and some other component of the octadecapeptide sequence are needed for leucophorotropic activity.

AB  - Pollution of water and sediments by industrial discharges of heavy metals, mainly cadmium (Cd), threatens the biota of mangrove ecotones around the mouth of the Tuy river, in northern-central Venezuela. Short-term lethal Cd concentrations were determined in adult male Uca rapax collected from a clean site and kept in 75% seawater (SW). The 96-h LC(50) obtained, 380 mu mol (= 43 mg) Cd liter(-1), is remarkably higher than values previously reported for other crustacean, mollusc or fish species. Tissue accumulation of Cd was examined in crabs acclimated to 125, 75 or 25% SW and exposed to sublethal CdCl2 levels ranging from 9.0 to 225 mu mol liter(-1) (i.e. 1.0-25 mg Cd liter(-1)). The metal contents of carapace, gills, hepatopancreas, muscle and hemolymph rose pronouncedly at the highest concentration tested and particularly in the crabs treated in dilute (= 25%) SW. In the latter, analyses of the relative distribution of whole-body Cd burden showed that about 80% is in the carapace, 2.4% in the gills, 4% in hepatopancreas, 3% in muscle, 9.3 in other viscerae, 1% is bound to the dried solids of hemolymph and ca. 0.2% appears to be in solution in this fluid. Exposure of crabs to Cd in dilute SW enhances the rates of entry or uptake of the metal, possibly mediated by Ca2+ transport mechanisms, and may exceed the detoxifying capacity of organs such as the hepatopancreas. Thus, Cd may be more harmful to crab populations experiencing frequent fluctuations of ambient salinity, such as are usual in mangrove swamps.

AB  - Transbranchial potentials (TP) and sodium or chloride fluxes were measured in an apparatus designed for the simultaneous perfusion of eight isolated gills of Uca rapax. In anterior gills perfused with U. rapax-saline (US) the TP varied almost linearly from -7.5 to +10 mV inside, and in posterior gills from +2 to -8.5 mV (inside), on exposure to salinities ranging from 8.7 through 52 parts per thousand, i.e. 25 to 150% sea-water (100% = 34.6 parts per thousand, S). Sodium influx and efflux in anterior gills exposed to US, 8.7 or 43.3 parts per thousand S (0.7 to 4.0 mmol h(-1) g(-1) dry wt) were always greater than in posterior gills (0.5 mmol h(-1)). The chloride fluxes were slightly smaller than sodium fluxes in anterior gills, while in the posterior gills the chloride influx (2.8 to 4.6 mmol h(-1)) was always larger than chloride efflux (0.6 to 1.1 mmol h(-1)) or the sodium fluxes. At least three ion-transport mechanisms may be present in these gills: (1) an internal (=basolateral), ouabain-sensitive Na+, K+ pump, restricted to anterior gills; (2) a furosemide-sensitive Na+, K+, 2Cl(-) (plus water) transporter, apparently restricted to posterior gills, and (3) a Na+ exchanger (and possibly other as yet unidentified ion transporters, as suggested by large increases of the chloride influxes caused by amiloride), probably located on the apical membranes of the epithelial cells of both gill types. The differential selectivity of the gills of U. rapax for sodium or chloride may Limit the transbranchial movements of either ion, without a reduction of the overall permeability of these crabs.

AB  - Adult male Uca rapax, collected from the central coast of Venezuela in early 1994 were gradually acclimated to salinities ranging from 1.7 to 139 parts per thousand S. The hemolymph osmolality (761+/-15mOsmol in crabs from 26 parts per thousand S) changed less than three-fold over the entire range of concentrations tested. The urine was isosmotic with the hemolymph in crabs exposed to dilutions < 26 parts per thousand S, and significantly hyperosmotic in those exposed to media > 34.8 parts per thousand S. The hemolymph levels of Na+, Cl-, K+, Ca2+ and Mg2+ (320+/-13, 405+/-17, 7.8+/-0.7, 7.2+/-0.1 and 31+/-2.2 mmol l(-1), respectively, in crabs acclimated to 26 parts per thousand S) were maintained fairly constant over the range from 8.7 to 99 parts per thousand S, decreasing by 15% in the more dilute media or increasing sharply to about twice those values in crabs from 139 parts per thousand S. The excretory organs contributed to the osmoionic regulation of the hemolymph in crabs exposed to < 3.5 or to > 34.8 parts per thousand S, by means of the partial reabsorption or excretion, respectively, of salts from or into the urine. The results described place U. rapax among the most powerful hypo/hyper-regulating crustaceans known.

AB  - We studied variations in the optical properties of the compound eyes of Uca lactea annulipes using in vivo optical and histological techniques. The distribution of resolving power in the eyes of this fiddler crab species is typical for arthropods that inhabit flat environments: the eyes possess a panoramic equatorial acute zone for vertical resolution and a steep decrease of resolution away from the eye equator in the dorsal and ventral visual fields, The dimensions of the cellular components of the ommatidia vary accordingly: in the equatorial part of the eyes, facets are larger, and crystalline cones and rhabdoms are longer than in the dorsal and ventral parts of the eyes. Along the eye equator, horizontal resolution is low compared with vertical resolution and varies little throughout the visual field, The eyes of Uca lactea annulipes are unusual in that the gradient of vertical anatomical and optical resolution is steeper in the dorsal than in the ventral visual field. We interpret this difference as indicating that the information content of the world as seen by the crabs differs above and below the horizon line in specific and predictable ways.

AB  - With their eyes on long vertical stalks, their panoramic visual field and their pronounced equatorial acute zone for vertical resolving power, the visual system of fiddler crabs is exquisitely tuned to the geometry of vision in the flat world of inter-tidal mudflats. The crabs live as burrow-centred grazers in dense, mixed-sex, mixed-age and mixed-species colonies, with the active space of an individual rarely exceeding 1 m<Superscript>2supercript stop. The full behavioural repertoire of fiddler crabs can thus be monitored over extended periods of time on a moment to moment basis together with the visual information they have available to guide their actions. These attributes make the crabs superb subjects for analysing visual tasks and the design of visual processing mechanisms under natural conditions, a prerequisite for understanding the evolution of visual systems. In this review we show, on the one hand, how deeply embedded fiddler crab vision is in the behavioural and the physical ecology of these animals and, on the other hand, how their behavioural options are constrained by their perceptual limitations. Studying vision in fiddler crabs reminds us that vision has a topography, that it is context-dependent and pragmatic and that there are perceptual limits to what animals can know and therefore care about.

AB  - Fiddler crabs inhabit intertidal sand- and mudflats, where they live in dense colonies and are active on the surface during low tide. They exhibit a rich behavioural repertoire, with frequent interactions between animals in the context of territorial and mating activities. Male fiddler crabs have one massively enlarged and conspicuously coloured claw, which they use in waving displays and in fights with other males. The crabs carry their eyes on long, vertically oriented stalks high above the body and, as a consequence, see the bodies of conspecifics in the ventral visual field, below the local visual horizon, and against the mudflat surface as background. We filmed events in a colony of Uca vomeris with a normal video camera and an ultraviolet-sensitive camera placed at the eye height of an average crab, approximately 2-3 cm above ground. We also used a spectrographic imager and linear polarized filters to analyse the cues potentially available to the animals for detecting, monitoring and possibly identifying each other. Areas of high contrast in mudflat scenes include specular reflections on the wet cuticle of crabs that are horizontally polarised. Besides specular reflections, some parts of the cuticle generate high- contrast signals against the mudflat background, both at wavelengths between 400 and 700 nm, and in the ultraviolet region between 300 and 400 nm. Uca vomeris can be very colourful: the different parts of the large claw of the male are white, orange or red. The carapace colours of both males and females can range from a mottled yellowish green brown, to a brilliant light blue. White and blue colours contrast starkly with the mudflat background, especially in the ultraviolet wavelengths. Under stress, the blue and white colours can change within minutes to a duller and darker blue or to a dull white.

AB  - Almost all known arthropod compound eyes exhibit regional variations of resolving power, absolute light, spectral and polarisation sensitivity which are likely to be matched to the probability of significant events and the availability of cues in the visual world, To understand the signal processing requirements that have led to the evolution of matched sensory and neural filters, we thus need a detailed description of the input signals to a visual system and of the tasks to be performed under natural operating conditions. We report here on the first steps we took in an attempt to reconstruct an animal's specific visual world with emphasis on the motion domain, Fiddler crabs (genus Uca) live in burrows on sand-and mudflats and are active during low tide, They carry their eyes on long, vertically oriented stalks and use vision to detect predators and conspecific signals generated by males waving one massively enlarged claw, The crabs sit on the ground plane of a flat world, where significant events are most likely to occur in a narrow band around the horizon, We recorded scenes in a crab colony with a video camera at crab eye height, The salience of relevant features in the spatial, spectral and polarisation domains was analysed in digitised video images and short sequences of film mere processed by a two-dimensional network of motion detectors at various spatial scales, The output of the network provides us with histograms of the direction and strength of motion signals in various spatio-temporal frequency bands. We discuss our results in terms of detection problems, predictability of events, global vs local information content and higher level motion processing involved in intraspecific communication.

AB  - Caged fiddler crabs, Uca pugilator, were exposed to field ULV applications to measure the impact of fenthion. Two nozzle systems. conventional flat-fan nozzles (Tee Jet 8002SS) and high-pressure hydraulic nozzles (1/8 MIS). were compared using single spray swaths. Fenthion residues were detected throughout the 4.83-km test zone for both systems. Heavy ground deposits (650-1,670 mug/m(2)) of fenthion were found within 1 km using the flat-fan nozzle systems, which resulted in 80% fiddler crab mortality. Less than 100 mug/m(2) fenthion ground deposits were detected during the high-pressure nozzle trials. No fiddler crab mortality was observed within the first 1-km zone following 3 single swath applications repeated during 3 consecutive nights. We found also that when the fiddler crabs were exposed to 700-800 mug/m(2) fenthion. mortality Occurred. Significant crab mortality (>50%) was observed when residues exceeded 1.000 mug/m(2).

AB  - Background: A female preference for intense sexual visual signals is widespread in animals. Although the preferences for a signal per se and for the intensity of the signal were often regarded to have the identical origin, no study has demonstrated if this is true. It was suggested that the female fiddler crabs prefer males with courtship structures because of direct benefit to escape predation. Here we tested if female preference for both components (i.e. presence and size) of the courtship structure in Uca lactea is from the sensory bias to escape predation. If both components have the identical origin, females should show the same response to different-sized courtship structures regardless of predation risk. Results: First, we observed responses of mate-searching female U. lactea to courting males with full-sized, half-sized and no semidomes which were experimentally manipulated. Females had a directional preference for males with bigger semidomes within normal variation. Thereafter, we tested the effect of predation risk on the female bias in the non-courtship context. When threatened by an avian mock predator, females preferentially approached burrows with full-sized semidomes regardless of reproductive cycles (i.e. reproductive periods and nonreproductive periods). When the predator cue was absent, however, females preferred burrows with semidomes without discriminating structure size during reproductive periods but did not show any bias during nonreproductive periods. Conclusions: Results indicate that selection for the size of courtship structures in U. lactea may have an origin in the function to reduce predation risk, but that the preference for males with structures may have evolved by female choice, independent of predation pressure.

AB  - To appreciate the mechanisms governing olfactory-mediated behavior, processes of chemical signal production and transmission in fluid media lair or water) must be understood. With new tools becoming available in analytical chemistry and fluid dynamics, investigators can now quantitatively address the processes governing chemical signals in field habitats. This study identifies the role of amino acids as signal molecules regulating search behavior and foraging success by estuarine mud snails (Ilyanassa obsoleta). For the first time, methods are described for measuring chemical signal production, release, and transport in field habitats, over temporal and spatial scales consistent with olfactory information processing. Rates of advection and turbulent mixing were determined, and shear velocities and roughness Reynolds numbers were estimated to characterize bottom boundary layer hows. Nearly instantaneous chemical measurements were made using a computerized microprobe system and conservative tracer to establish the environmental distributions of signal molecules at rates similar to those sampled by olfactory receptor neurons. In addition, we determined the dissolved free amino acid (DFAA) compositions (up to 18 amino acids), concentrations, and effluent release rates for live intact and injured fiddler crabs (Uca pugilator) and hard clams (Mercenaria mercenaria), which are common prey from mud snail habitats. The: field site populated by mud snails was found to be more conducive at broadcasting stronger chemical signals over longer distances than most other estuarine and ocean habitats. Live fiddler crabs released amino acids at very low fluxes (0.1 nmol.min(-1).g [wet tissue mass](-1)), while live intact clams took up amino acids from seawater. Once injured, hard clams and fiddler crabs released DFAAs at 88 and 6804 nmol.min(-1).g(-1), respectively. Mud snails were significantly attracted to injured clams and crabs, but not to intact prey, as compared with controls. Synthetic mixtures of amino acids, simulating fluids leaking from injured prey, were also highly attractive. When we tested for effects of amino acid composition, concentration, mean volume flow rate (of chemical input), and flux, in separate experiments, only Aux directly correlated with the number of mud snails attracted. The attraction of mud snails is thus more tightly coupled to the physical transport of chemical stimuli than to the molecular properties of specific amino acids.

AB  - Endocrine disruption by anthropogenic chemicals has been well documented for vertebrates but has not been extensively studied for invertebrates. However, concern has been expressed over the possibility that the same environmental agents that interfere with male development in vertebrates may also perturb male development in invertebrates, for instance, cladocerans. My study with Daphnia magna has shown that the estrogenic xenobiotics diethylstilbestrol (DES) and endosulfan do not interfere with male differentiation but do inhibit molting of daphnids. Further investigation revealed that some other estrogenic agents, such as a PCB formulation Aroclor 1242, diethyl phthalate, and 2,4,5-trichlorobiphenyl (PCB29), also delay molting of Daphnia magna . To gain insight into the mechanisms for the inhibition of molting caused by these estrogenic agents, a chitinolytic enzyme, chitobiase (also known as N-acetyl-β-glucosaminidase), was used because this chitin-degrading enzyme is at the terminal of cascades of endocrine events that control molting of crustaceans and appears to be a product of genes that are regulated by the arthropod molting hormone, 20-hydroxyecdysone. I found that activity of chitobiase in the epidermis and hepatopancreas of Uca pugilator is modulated over the duration of the molting cycle with maximum enzymatic activity in both tissues occurring in late premolt, substage D3-4 . This pattern of change in chitobiase activity coincides well with changes in the hemolymph titer of ecdysteroids during the molting cycle reported for the same species. Multiple injections of 20-hydroxyecdysone into premolt substage D1 fiddler crabs elevated chitobiase activity in the epidermis and hepatopancreas. These results are the first direct evidence that chitobiase is a marker for the actions of the molting hormone in a crustacean. To determine whether the delay of molting in the presence of estrotrogeic xenobiotics is linked to the inhibition of activity of chitobiase, Uca pugilator was exposed up to seven days to Aroclor 1242, DES, diethyl phthalate, endosulfan, 4-octylphenol, 4-tert -octylphenol, and PCB29. Significant declines in chitobiase activity were apparent in the epidermis and hepatopancreas of Uca pugilator . The inhibition of epidermal enzymatic activity by Aroclor 1242, DES, endosulfan, and PCB29 can at least partly account for the slowing of molting in crustaceans caused by these chemicals since chitobiase is essential for degradation of the old chitinous exoskeleton. Because activity of chitobiase is regulated by 20-hydroxyecdysone, the inhibition of enzymatic activity in the presence of various estrogenic agents strongly suggests that exposure to these compounds disturbs the Y-organ-ecdysteroid receptor axis in Uca pugilator . External features of a sexually abnormal fiddler crab that carries characteristics of both sexes are described.

AB  - Endocrine disruption by anthropogenic chemicals has been well documented for vertebrates, but has not been extensively studied for invertebrates except the imposex phenomenon in gastropods. Crustaceans are one of the larger animal groups. Concern has been expressed over the possibility that the same environmental agents that interfere with endocrine functions of vertebrates may also perturb hormonally regulated processes of crustaceans. My studies with Daphnia magna have shown that the estrogenic xenobiotics diethylstilbestrol (DES), endosulfan, Aroclor 1242, and diethyl phthalate, and the putative estrogenic agent 2,4,5-trichlorobiphenyl (PCB29) inhibit molting of daphnids. To gain insight into the mechanisms for the inhibition of molting by these estrogenic agents, a larger crustacean model, the fiddler crab, Uca pugilator, was used. It was found that the delay of molting in the presence of these estrogenic xenobiotics can at least be partly accounted for by the inhibition of activity of chitobiase (also known as N-acetyl-β-glucosaminidase) in the epidermis of Uca pugilator since this enzyme is essential for degradation of the old chitinous exoskeleton. Because activity of chitobiase is regulated by the molting hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone and none of the above chemicals are capable of inhibiting chitobiase activity in vitro, the inhibition of chitobiase activity in the presence of these xenobiotics strongly suggests that exposure to these compounds disturbs the Y-organ-ecdysteroid receptor axis in Uca pugilator.

AB  - Aquatic pollution has led to the accumulation of various xenobiotics in crustaceans. A number of these environmental chemicals have been found to interfere with molting of crustaceans. Results of initial mechanistic studies with Uca pugilator suggest that the disruption of molting results from the disturbance to the Y-organ-ecdysteroid receptor (EcR) axis by xenobiotics. Such disturbance to the Y-organ-EcR axis can be caused by interference with epidermal ecdysteroid signaling and/or alterations in ecdysteroidogenesis and/or ecdysteroid disposition. Because the adverse impacts on crustacean molting cannot be readily seen in the wild, the disruption of molting represents an invisible form of endocrine disruption.

AB  - Like other brachyuran crustaceans, fiddler crabs, Uca pugilator, are normally gonochoristic, exhibiting striking sexual dimorphism. Males are characterized by a pair of extremely asymmetrical chelipeds and a narrow abdomen while females typically have a pair of small, identical claws and a broad abdomen, which virtually covers the entire sternum. I report herein five sexually abnormal fiddler crabs, representing four different forms of sexual abnormalities. In one form of sexual anomalies, male-type chelipeds and female-type abdomen occur on the same specimen, suggesting that the endocrine mechanism underlying the occurrence of asymmetrical claw is different from that for the development of male-type pleopods. All these crabs were obtained from the Gulf Specimen Marine Laboratories, Inc., Panacea, Florida. At present, it is still unknown whether there is an environmental etiology behind these sexual aberrations.

AB  - Fiddler crabs, Uca pugilator, exhibit striking sexual dimorphism with males characterized by a pair of extremely asymmetrical chelipeds and a narrow abdomen and females having two small, symmetrical claws and a wide abdomen that covers the entire ventral side of the cephalothorax. Four different forms of sexual aberrations have recently been discovered among the crabs purchased from the Gulf Specimen Marine Laboratories, Inc. of Panacea, Florida. In one form, the sexually abnormal crabs had a wide abdomen, female-type pleopods and a pair of asymmetrical chelipeds. In another form, the specimen possessed a pair of symmetrical, enlarged claws and a female abdomen, along with the female-type pleopods. A specimen with reduced asymmetry in chelipeds, an intermediate abdomen, male-type pleopods (gonopods) and female-type apertures was discovered. Representing the fourth form is a specimen possessing a pair of uneven claws with reduced asymmetry, female gonopores and an intermediate abdomen with both male- and female-type pleopods. Whether an environmental etiology underlies these sexual anomalies is unknown.

AB  - 9-cis-Retinoic acid (9CRA) and all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) are known to be involved in the regulation of glucose homeostasis in vertebrates by inducing insulin release and expression of glucose transporter proteins. In view of the fact that both 9CRA and ATRA are endogenous to the fiddler crab, Uca pugilator, that a retinoid X receptor exists in this fiddler crab and that activities of insulin-like and insulin-like growth factor-like peptides have been reported for crustaceans, we investigated whether 9CRA and ATRA also play a role in glucose homeostasis in U. pugilator. Neither 9CRA nor ATRA was found to produce hypoglycemic effects at a dose of 10 mug/g live mass. However, 9CRA, but not ATRA, induced hyperglycemia. Such 9CRA-induced hyperglycemia was apparently mediated by the eyestalk hormone CHH since injection of 9CRA into eyestalk-ablated crabs did not result in hyperglycemia. ATRA was found to have an inhibitory effect on the recovery of blood glucose concentration following ATRA administration. Discussion on the possible mechanisms for the actions of 9CRA and ATRA was presented. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - We describe an in vivo screening assay that uses epidermal chitinase activity as the endpoint following a 7-day exposure of Uca pugilator to test chemicals. Chitinase, a chitinolytic enzyme, is the end product of endocrine cascades of a multi-hormonal system for control of crustacean molting. Wherever a molt-interfering agent adversely impacts the Y-organ-ecdysteroid receptor axis, the effect should be manifested by the activity of chitinase in the epidermis. Therefore, epidermal chitinase activity is an ideal endpoint for molt-interfering effects of xenobiotics. The validity of epidermal chitinase activity being used for such a purpose is supported by our finding that two injections of 20-hydroxyecdysone at 25 mug/g live weight induced a twofold increase in chitinase activity in the epidermis of U. pugilator. A total of nine chemicals were screened for molting hormone and anti-molting activities. o,p'-DDT was found to significantly inhibit epidermal chitinase activity while kepone and methoxychlor exhibited a tendency of inhibition of enzymatic activity. None of the remaining six chemicals, namely, p,p'-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (p,p'-DDT), atrazine, tributyltin (TBT), methoprene, dieldrin and permethrin, had an effect on epidermal chitinase activity.

AB  - Seven-day exposure of fiddler crabs, Uca pugilator, to diethyl phthalate at 50.0 mg l(-1) significantly inhibited the activity of chitobiase (also known as N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase) in the epidermis and hepatopancreas. Epidermal chitobiase activity of crabs exposed to 10.0 mg l(-1) 4-(tert)-octylphenol for 7 days significantly decreased. PCB29 at 0.5 and 2.0 mg l(-1) significantly inhibited chitobiase activity in the epidermis and hepatopancreas of crabs exposed for 3 days. The inhibitory effects rendered by diethyl phthalate and PCB29 can at least partly account for the delayed molting they cause because chitobiase is needed to break down the old exoskeleton of crustaceans prior to ecdysis. Since chitinolytic enzymes are apparently the products of ecdysteroid regulated genes in arthropods, the decline in chitobiase activity after exposure to diethyl phthalate, 4-(tert)-octylphenol, and PCB29 along with the delayed molting they cause strongly suggests that these xenobiotics disturb the Y-organ-ecdysteroid receptor axis. Such disturbance may involve an interaction between ecdysteroid receptors and steroid mimics where the steroid mimics act as antagonists of endogenous steroid molting hormones, and/or arise from the interference with synthesis and excretion of ecdysteroids by these compounds.

AB  - The effects of exposure of the fiddler crab, Uca pugilator, to the estrogenic xenobiotics Aroclor 1242, diethylstilbestrol (DES), endosulfan, and 4-octylphenol on chitobiase activity in the epidermis and hepatopancreas were investigated. Endosulfan at 0.05 and 0.20 mg/liter significantly inhibited chitobiase in the epidermal and hepatopancreatic tissues of U. pugilator exposed for 3 days. After a 7-day exposure there was a significant decrease in epidermal chitobiase activity in the animals exposed to Aroclor 1242 at 8.0 mg/Iiter, DES at 5.0 mg/liter, and endosulfan at 0.05 and 0.20 mg/liter, while Aroclor 1242 at 2.0 and 8.0 mg/liter and endosulfan at 0.05 and 0.20 mg/liter significantly inhibited chitobiase activity in the hepatopancreas. 4-Octylphenol at 2.0 and 10.0 mg/liter had no significant effect on epidermal chitobiase activity, while 7 days of exposure to 10.0mg/liter 4-octylphenol significantly inhibited hepatopan-creatic chitobiase activity. Because chitobiase is necessary for the partial digestion of the chitinous exoskeleton as part of the molting process, inhibition of this enzyme by these estrogenic agents can account for at least some of the slowing of molting that occurs when crustaceans are exposed to these agents. Possible mechanisms regarding the decline of chitobiase activity in the presence of estrogenic agents are presented. (C) 1999 Academic Press.

AB  - The activity of chitobiase, also known as N-acetyl-beta- glucosaminidase, in the epidermis and hepatopancreas of the fiddler crab Uca pugilator (Bosc, 1802), during the molting cycle, was investigated. A pH optimum of 5 to 6 was found for the enzymatic activity in both the epidermis and hepatopancreas. The temperature optimum for epidermal and hepatopancreatic chitobiase activities was 50 to 60 degrees C. The K-m values for epidermal and hepatopancreatic chitobiase activities at 19 degrees C were 0.190 +/- 0.027 and 0.203 +/- 0.016 mM 4-methylumbelliferyl-N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminide respectively. Hepatopancreatic chitobiase activity was significantly higher than epidermal enzymatic activity in all the molt cycle stages tested except Postmolt Stage A-B. Chitobiase activity Varied significantly during the molting cycle, with the epidermal enzymatic activity in Premolt Stage D3-4 significantly higher than in Stage C (intermolt) and Premolt Stage D-0, whereas hepatopancreatic chitobiase activity in Premolt Stage D3-4 Was significantly higher than in all other molt stages tested. The patterns of chitobiase activity in the epidermis and hepatopancreas correlate well with the hemolymph titer of ecdysteroids in U. pugilator during the molting cycle; this suggests that chitobiase activity in both tissues is regulated at least in part by the steroid molting hormones.

AB  - A new staining method for detection of N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase on denaturing SDS polyacrylamide gels was developed. The isoenzyme pattern of N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase in the epidermis of the fiddler crab, Uca pugilator, is different from that in the hepatopancreas. Two isoforms of N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase, with molecular weights of 89 and 45.6 kDa, are present in the hepatopancreas while there is only one form of N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase, 89 kDa, in the epidermis. No sexual dimorphism was found in these patterns of N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase isoenzymes. The characteristic isoenzyme patterns in the epidermis and hepatopancreas occurred consistently throughout the molting cycle. Injections of the molting hormone, 20-hydroxyecdysone, at 25 mu g/g live weight, into crabs in premolt substage D-1, significantly increased N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase activity in the epidermis by 86%. Since only one form of N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase: 89 kDa, is present in the epidermis, the elevation in epidermal enzymatic activity after 20-hydroxyecdysone administration is entirely accounted for by this N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase isoenzyme. The results reported herein are the first direct evidence that in a crustacean N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase activity is regulated by the steroid molting hormone.

AB  - The external features of an intersex fiddler crab, Uca pugilator, are described. Both male- and female-type sexual characteristics occur on the specimen. This sexually abnormal individual exhibits reduced bilateral asymmetry in its chelipeds. Its abdomen is intermediate between those of a typical male and a typical female. The first and second pairs of pleopods closely resemble those found in a typical male. One female-type pleopod occurs on the right side of the third abdominal segment, while on the fifth segment of the abdomen there exist two female-type pleopods, one on each side. No male genital apertures were found, but two female gonopores occur, one on each side of the midline of the thoracic segment that bears the third pair of walking legs. Possible causes for the sexual aberrations found in this specimen are discussed.

AB  - The giant mudskipper (Periophthalmodon schlosseri) is one of the commonly found mudskipper species living and it makes a significant biomass value in the mangrove ecosystem. Samples of this mudskipper species were collected and analysed for stomach content and stable isotope ratios (delta C-13 and delta N-15) to determine their food preference. The stomach content analysis showed four groups of food items: fiddler crabs (Uca sp.), medaka fish (Oryzias sp.), juveniles of indeterminate fish species and indeterminate remains of prey items. P. schlosseri females prefer to prey on Oryzias sp. (57.8%), Uca sp. (26.7%) and juveniles of indeterminate fish species (6.7%), while the males prefer to prey on Uca sp. (84.6%) and Oryzias sp. (7.7%). The indeterminate remaining prey items were 8.9% and 7.7% for respective sexes. The stable isotope analysis showed Uca sp. and Oryzias sp. being the main food items for P. schlosseri. The values of delta C-13 and delta N-15 ratios also showed differences in food preference among sexes, where females of all life stages prefer to prey more on Oryzias sp. and little Uca sp. In contrast, the male P. schlosseri prefer to prey only on Uca sp. throughout their life, with the exception of juvenile male P. schlosseri, which suggested they also consume a small amount of Oryzias sp. Behavioural differences among the sexes and life stages were suggested to cause differences in food selection. The size of the food items also influences food preference.

AB  - One million waders overwinter on the intertidal flats of Guinea-Bissau (1570 km2; Fig. 1). Curlew Sandpiper (250,000), Bar-tailed Godwit (156,000), Knot (144,000) and Little Stint (123,000) are the four most common species (Table 1). The estimated totals, based on counts made during the winter of 1982/1983 (81 km2 counted) and the winter of 1986/1987 (278 km2 counted), are an improvement on the estimates by Poorter & Zwarts (1984) whose extrapolation was based solely on the counts done during the first winter. The counts were carried out on the low water feeding areas, since high water counts were impracticable. Most waders roosted in mangroves where they were easily overlooked. The preference for roosting in mangroves or on the ground differed per species (Fig. 3). Low tide distribution was related to the type of sediment (Figs 2, 6 and 7) and the presence of the fiddler crab Uca tangeri (Fig. 5). The species composition in and outside the burrowing zone of Uca was completely different (Fig. 4). Whimbrel and Common Sandpiper appear to be typical Uca specialists, whereas the Calidris species and the Bar-tailed Godwit rarely fed on Uca. Female Curlews foraged relatively more inside the Uca zone than males (Fig. 8). Curlews feeding on Uca extracted them from their burrows: the longer the bill the more crabs within reach. The number and biomass of Uca accessible for the short-billed Curlew was so low (Fig. 9) that most of them switched to other prey. Female Bar-tailed Godwits fed mainly along the tidal edge, whereas most males were found on the intertidal flats (Fig. 8). The rare Uca specialists among the Bar-tailed Godwits were the (long-billed) females; prey accessibility is probably the explanation, as is the case with the Curlew. Sex ratio counts revealed that half of the Curlews and Bar-tailed Godwits in Guinea-Bissau were males. Wader density and predation pressure on the intertidal areas in Guinea-Bissau (Fig. 10) and elsewhere are compared (Table 2, Fig. 11).

AB  - Whimbrels Numenius phaeopux preparing for their spring departure from the Banc d'Arguin were able to increase their daily food intake to 1.5 times the winter level. This was made possible by an increase in the proportion of the day during which their prey were available. First, their main prey on the beach, the fiddler crab Uca tangeri, occurred more frequently on the surface. Second, two other crab species that were taken from eelgrass beds, Panopeus africanus and Callinectes marginatus, were more active later in the spring. It would not be possible for Whimbrels to increase their body mass faster than they actually did because a digestive bottleneck limited the rate they could ingest food (Zwarts & Dirksen 1990). Neither would they be able to start gaining mass earlier because of the low prety availability during that period. Consequently Whimbrels simply could not leave the Banc d'Arguin for their European stopover sites before the end of April. The annual cycle of the Whimbrel appears intimately geared to the annual cycles of their tropical prey species.

AB  - Whimbrels feeding on crabs took food with a low rate of return because half of the mass was inorganic, and 30% of the organic mass within the skeleton itself was not digestible. The digestibility of this prey (65%) was therefore below the average efficiency with which birds usually digest fish or flesh. The Wimbrel is able to metabolize 99% of the fat, 74% of the protein (correcting for urinary nitrodgen production) and 1% of the carbohydrates (found mainly in the skeleton). The apparent and true metabolizable energy content of crabs was 7 and 8 kJ g-1 dry mass, respectively. When more food was available, the bird became more selective by refusing a greater part of the skeleton. As a consequence, the relative amount of flesh in the food increased. Food digestiblity decreased when more food was ingested per day. This was probably due to a third factor: intake rate increased the amount of food taken and a higher intake rate reduced prey digestibility. However, since the decrease in digestibility was less than the increase in intake rate, ingesting food at the higher rate was a profitable strategy.
