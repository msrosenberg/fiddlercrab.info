Uca	"Leach, 1814"	major	"This subgenus is equivalent to Crane's <em class=""species"">Uca.</em> <em class=""species"">U. tangeri</em> is sometimes placed in this subgenus and sometimes placed in its own monotypic subgenus (below)."	53280	.
Afruca	"Crane, 1975"	tangeri	"This monotypic subgenus consists of the single species <em class=""species"">U. tangeri.</em> It is sometimes combined into the subgenus <em class=""species"">Uca.</em> "	.	.
Minuca	"Bott, 1954"	mordax	"This subgenus is largely equivalent to a combination of Crane's <em class=""species"">Minuca</em> and <em class=""species"">Boboruca.</em> I have also included <em class=""species"">U. pugilator</em> and <em class=""species"">U. panacea,</em> which Crane placed with the <em class=""species"">Leptuca.</em>"	53288	4316243
Leptuca	"Bott, 1973"	stenodactylus	"This subgenus is largely equivalent to Crane's <em class=""species"">Celuca,</em> without any of the Indo-West Pacific species. This subgenus is certainly paraphyletic and quite possibly polyphyletic. It is essentially the catch-all group for any broad-fronted American species which is not part of the <em class=""species"">Minuca.</em>"	6771	12020223
Austruca	"Bott, 1973"	lactea	"This subgenus is the <em>U. lactea</em> species complex (formerly part of Crane's <em class=""species"">Celuca</em>), plus a few recently identified/resurrected species."	1239987	33744938
Paraleptuca	"Bott, 1973"	chlorophthalmus	"This subgenus is roughly equivalent to Crane's <em class=""species"">Amphiuca</em>, minus <em class=""species"">U. inversa.</em>"	1239991	33744958
Cranuca	"Beinlich & von Hagen, 2006"	inversa	"This monotypic subgenus consists of the single species <em class=""species"">U. inversa.</em>"	1239992	33744962
Gelasimus	"Latreille, 1817"	vocans	"This subgenus is equivalent to Crane's <em class=""species"">Thalassuca.</em> The exact status of <em class=""species"">U. formosensis</em> is somewhat questionable. It may belong here, to the <em class=""species"">Tubuca,</em> or be in a new subgenus entirely. See <a href=""references/Shih1999.3.html"">Shih <em>et al.</em> (1999)</a> and <a href=""references/Rosenberg2001.html"">Rosenberg (2001)</a> for more information."	1239990	3119013
Tubuca	"Bott, 1973"	urvillei	"This subgenus is equivalent to Crane's <em class=""species"">Deltuca.</em>"	1239988	33744946
Australuca	"Crane, 1975"	bellator	"This subgenus is essentially unchanged from Crane's original description, except for the addition of a few species described after the original designation."	53284	12020232
