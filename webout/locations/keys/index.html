      <p>
          The taxonomic keys on this sites are explicitly designed to serve as field/photographic identification keys for fiddler crabs and thus only focus on characters that may reasonably be seen without dissection, microscopy, or other invasive procedures. As such there may be occasional ambiguity in the division of very similar species. The keys include both male and female fiddler crabs for each species as diagnostic characters may vary between the sexes.      </p>
      <p>
          All of these guides are classic dichotomous keys where at each step of the process a single decision is made to follow one of two paths, based on differential characteristics, until a species is identified or no further division is possible. Figures and descriptions of characters and variants are generally included as part of the key. Additional details and caveats may be found in footnotes.      </p>
      <p>
          All of the keys are algorithmically generated from a data matrix of species characteristics. This allows us to create an individual key for every location, based only on the species thought to be present at that location. It also means that the order of splits in each key are driven by an algorithm rather than explicit human design and different keys may prioritize different characters at different stages.      </p>
      <p>
          A discussion of the development of this key generating algorithm can be found in <a href="http://www.rosenberglab.net/blog/2019/05/02/automatic-taxonomic-key-generation-part-1-introduction/">a series of 10 blog posts</a> on my lab website. The <a href="https://github.com/msrosenberg/TaxKeyGen">original code is found on Github</a>, although it has since been modified to work within the larger framework of this website generator.      </p>

          We welcome comments or corrections about these guides and hope they prove to be useful.      </p>
