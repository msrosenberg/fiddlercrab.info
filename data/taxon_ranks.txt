subfamily	subfamilies	Within the Ocypodidae, there is some uncertainty as to the relationship between fiddler crabs and ghost crabs, such that at this time fiddler crabs are not all within a single named taxon to the exclusion of non-fiddler crabs. Fiddler crabs are split between two subfamilies: (1) Gelasiminae and (2) Ucinae or Ocypodinae, depending on the hypothesis of the relationship between this subset of fiddler crabs and ghost crabs one believes. If the relationship between all fiddler crabs is resolved such that they can be placed in a single group to the exclusion of ghost crabs, that group would be the single subfamily, Ucinae.
supertribe	supertribes	Under the current taxonomic system of two subfamilies, the supertribes are unnecessary/redundant as each subfamily would contain only a single supertribe. These supertribes become more important if fiddler crabs are reduced to a single subfamily.
tribe	tribes	Under the pair of subfamilies and/or supertribes, fiddler crabs can be split into three tribes. These tribes are likely to be stable even if the number of subfamilies changes.

genus	genera	Until recently, fiddler crabs were generally considered to belong to a single genus, <em class="species">Gelasimus</em> for most of the 19<sup>th</sup> century, <em class="species">Uca</em> for the 20<sup>th</sup> and early 21<sup>st</sup>. [[Shih2016.2,.out]] divided fiddler crabs into eleven genera, all of which had previously been considered subgenera. These genera fall into three main groups represented by the tribes described above. 
subgenus	subgenera	Prior to [[Shih2016.2,.out]], all fiddler crabs were considered to be a single genus and thus they were divided into subgenera within that genus. With the raising of the old subgenera to new genera, most of the new genera do not currently have subgenera. However, a few of the new genera have distinct enough subgroupings of species to warrant subgenera of their own.
