1	Claw terminology	A claw is made up of two articulating parts: the largest part is called the <em>manus</em> and consists of the base of the claw and a fixed/unmovable finger called the <em>pollex.</em> The smaller part is the articulated, movable finger called the <em>dactyl.</em> In standard position, the dactyl is the upper finger and the pollex is the lower finger. The space between the pollex and the dactyl is referred to as the gape.	generic1.png|.
