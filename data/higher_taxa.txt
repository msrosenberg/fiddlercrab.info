Ocypodidae	family	.	Rafinesque1815	>>Ocypode	Fiddler Crabs are in the family Ocypodidae, along with Ghost Crabs and Mangrove Crabs.	.	.
Gelasiminae	subfamily	familyOcypodidae	Miers1886	>Gelasimus	Under current nomenclature, the subfamily Gelasiminae contains nine genera within two major subclades (two tribes within a single redundant supertribe). If all fiddler crabs are later found to be part of a single monophyletic clade, Gelasiminae would be eliminated as a subfamily in favor or Ucinae, and this group would be represented soley by the supertribe Gelasimitae.	.	.
Ucinae	subfamily	familyOcypodidae	Dana1851	>Uca	Under current nomenclature, the subfamily Ucinae contains two genera (which can be viewed as within a single tribe within a single supertribe). Depending on the precise relationship between fiddler crabs and ghost crabs, it is possible that this subfamily is invalid and a junior synonym for the ghost crab subfamily Ocypodinae. On the other hand, if all fiddler crabs are later found to be part of a single monophyletic clade, Ucinae would have priority as the name that represented the entirety of fiddlers (and thus eliminating the subfamily Gelasiminae).	.	.
Gelasimitae	supertribe	subfamilyGelasiminae	Miers1886	>Gelasimus	The supertribe Gelasimitae contains two tribes. Under current nomenclature it is redundant/identical in content with the subfamily Gelasiminae, but could serve an important nomenclatural purpose if fiddler crabs return to a single group in the subfamily Ucinae.	.	.
Ucitae	supertribe	subfamilyUcinae	Dana1851	>Uca	The supertribe Ucitae contains only a single tribe. Under current nomenclature it is redundant/identical in content with the subfamily Ucinae, but could serve an important nomenclatural purpose if Ucinae is expanded to include all fiddler crabs.	.	.
Minucini	tribe	supertribeGelasimitae	Bott1973.2	>Minuca	The Minucini contains the broad-front fiddler genera found along the coasts of the Americas.	.	.
Gelasimini	tribe	supertribeGelasimitae	Miers1886	>Gelasimus	The Gelasimini contains all of the fiddler crab genera found along the coasts and islands of the Indian Ocean and the central and western Pacific Ocean.	.	.
Ucini	tribe	supertribeUcitae	Dana1851	>Uca	The Ucini contains the narrow-front fiddler genera found along the American coasts and the single genus found on the eastern Atlantic Ocean. It is redundant/identical with the supertribe Ucitae, but included for rank symmetry.	.	.
Uca	genus	tribeUcini	Leach1814	major	The genus <em class="species">Uca</em> has a complicated history. The earliest description of the type species of <em class="species">Uca</em> is from a drawing in [[Seba1758,.out]], which he called <em class="species">Cancer uka una, Brasiliensibus</em> (shown below).</p><figure><img src="%%MEDIA_PATH%%art/Seba_Uca_una.jpg" style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0; text-align: center" alt="Seba's fiddler crab image" title="Seba's fiddler crab" /></figure><p>A number of authors subsequently used this same picture as a basis for naming the species ([[Manning1981,.in]]). <em class="species">Cancer vocans major</em> Herbst, 1782; <em class="species">Ocypode heterochelos</em> Lamarck, 1801; <em class="species">Cancer uka</em> Shaw and Nodder, 1802; and <em class="species">Uca una</em> Leach, 1814, are  all objective synonyms, because they are all based on the picture and  description from Seba. Because of this, the official type specimen of the  genus <em class="species">Uca</em> is <em class="species">Cancer vocans major.</em>  The earliest description of  this species based on actual specimens and not on Seba's drawing was <em class="species">Gelasimus platydactylus</em> Milne-Edwards, 1837.</p><blockquote>As an aside, Seba's name, <em class="species">Cancer uka una</em> comes from the nomenclature of [[Marcgrave1648,.out]], who mispelled &ldquo;u&ccedil;a una&rdquo; as &ldquo;uca una&rdquo;. Not only did Seba copy the mispelling, but he applied it to the fiddler crab instead of the mangrove crab (which is today called <em class="species">Ucides</em>) to which Marcgrave applied the name (see below). [[Latreille1817.2,Latreille's (1817)]] proposal of the generic name <em class="species">Gelasimus</em> for fiddler crabs was so that <em class="species">Uca</em> could be applied to mangrove crabs; as this was an invalid proposal, <em class="species">Uca</em> is retained for fiddlers, despite being due to a pair of errors [[Tavares1993,.out]].<figure class="syspic"><img src="%%MEDIA_PATH%%art/Marcgrave_Maracoani.png" alt="Marcgrave's Maracoani image" title="Marcgrave's Maracoani"><figcaption>Oldest known drawing of a fiddler crab ([[Marcgrave1648,.in]]).

This figure is believed to most likely represent <em class="species">Uca thayeri.</em></figcaption></figure></blockquote><p>For about 60 years, fiddler crabs were considered to be in the genus <em class="species">Gelasimus,</em> until [[Rathbun1897.1,.out]] showed that the abandonment of the older name <em class="species">Uca</em> did not conform to zoological naming conventions. The type species of <em class="species">Uca</em> was known as both <em class="species">Uca heterochelos</em> and <em class="species">U. platydactylus,</em> until [[Rathbun1918.2,.out]] suggested the adoption of <em class="species">U. heterochelos</em> as the valid name. Almost 50 years later, [[Holthuis1962,.out]] pointed out that <em class="species">U. heterochelos</em> was an objective junior synonym of <em class="species">U. major,</em> thus the type species has been referred to as <em class="species">U. major</em> ever since.</p><p>However, [[Bott1973.1,.out]] discovered that there has been a universal  misinterpretation of the type species; the species pictured by Seba is not the American species commonly referred to as <em class="species">U. major,</em> but rather the West African/Portuguese species called <em class="species">U. tangeri</em> (Eydoux, 1835) at the time. Correcting this error would have caused a somewhat painful change of names ([[Holthuis1979,.in]], [[Manning1981,.in]]). The type species would still be called <em class="species">U. major</em>, but would refer to the West African/European species rather than the American one; the American species, which has been called <em class="species">U. major</em> since 1962, would be called <em class="species">U. platydactylus,</em> a name not used since 1918.</p><p>To deal with this dilemma, the Society of Zoological Nomenclature officially designated the holotype of <em class="species">Gelasimus platydactylus</em> as a neotype of <em class="species">Cancer vocans major</em> ([[Holthuis1979,.in]], [[ICZN1983,.in]]). The result of this decision is that we retain the names <em class="species">U. major</em> for the American species and <em class="species">U. tangeri</em> for the West African/European species. It also means that although <em class="species">U. tangeri</em> is technically the species upon which the genus is named, <em class="species">U. major</em> (<em class="species">Cancer vocans major</em>) is still the official type species of the genus <em class="species">Uca.</em></p><p><em class="species">Uca</em> persisted as the sole genus of fiddler crabs until [[Shih2016.2,.out]] elevated eleven subgenera into separate genera. The genus <em class="species">Uca</em> now represents the large, narrow-front fiddlers found in the Americas.	53280	.
