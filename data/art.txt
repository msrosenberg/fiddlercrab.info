science	Marcgrave1648	Marcgrave	1648	Maracoani	Marcgrave_Maracoani	png	maracoani	This drawing is from Marcgrave (1648) and represents the oldest known drawing of a fiddler crab. It was labeled &ldquo;Maracoani&rdquo; and represents the namesake of the species {{maracoani}}. This identical image was reprinted in Jonston (1650) and in Piso (1658).
science	Marcgrave1648	Marcgrave	1648	Ciecie Ete	Marcgrave_Ciecie_Ete	png	thayeri	The other fiddler crab drawing found in Marcrgrave (1648), this was labeled &ldquo;Ciecie Ete&rdquo; (he also refers to a very similar species called &ldquo;Ciecie Panema&rdquo;). This figure is believed to most likely represent {{thayeri}}. This identical image was reprinted in Jonston (1650).
science	Marcgrave1648	Marcgrave	1648	Uca Una	Marcgrave_Uca_una	png	n/a	The drawing from Marcgrave (1648) labled &ldquo;Uca Una&rdquo; that eventually led (starting with an error by Seba) to the fiddler crab genus to be called <em class="species">Uca.</em> (A secondary error is Marcgrave's misspelling; it should have been &ldquo;Uça Una.&rdquo;) The figure actually represents the mangrove crab, today known as <em class="species">Ucides cordatus.</em> 
science	Petiver1704	Petiver	1704	Cancer parvus quadratus	Petiver_Cancer_parvus_quadratus	png	coarctata	This drawing is from Petiver (1704). He labeled it <em class="species">Cancer parvus quadratus.</em> To me the drawing looks most like the species {{coarctata}}. 
science	Rumphius1705	Rumphius	1705	Cancer Vocans	Rumphius_Cancer_Vocans	jpg	vocans	This drawing is from Rumphius (1705). He labeled it <em class="species">Cancer Vocans</em>, a species now known as {{vocans}}. This is the source of the name used by Linneaus when he first included fiddler crabs in his taxonomy.
science	Ryoan1712	Ryōan	1712-1713	つまじろ, 望潮蟹	Wakan_Sansai_Zyue	png	n/a	This drawing is from an illustrated Japanese Encyclopdedia known as the Wakan Sansai Zyue. This figures comes from the lower right corner of the page containing crabs in volume 46 (the pages are not clearly numbered). Harada (1993) believe this entry refers to a fiddler crab and I concur, even though the figure itself is ambiguous. The kanji at the very  bottom of the figure (俗云爪白蟹) literally translates to &ldquo;claw-white-crab,&rdquo; In particular, the third and fourth characters (爪白 = <em>tsumajiro</em>) literally mean &ldquo;animal whose feet are white,&ldquo; so the entire name is white-footed crab. The katakana immediately adjacent to those two characters (ツマジロ) and the hiragana above and to the right of it (つまじろ) are also pronounced <em>tsumajiro,</em> indicating spellings in the different alphabets.</p><p>The middle column of kanji immediately below the image (望潮蟹 = <em>wàng cháo xiè</em>) translates roughly to &ldquo;looking-at-tide crab&rdquo; in Mandarin; the katakana to its left (ワンチャヤウヒヤイ) is not Japanese, but rather a sylabolic pronounciation of the Chinese. This name matches the spirit of other translated names from the region (<em>e.g., </em> beckoning for the return of the tide) and still appears to be used to refer to fiddler crabs in China today.</p><p>The column of text to left of the figure (本綱望潮蟹生海中似膨媒而潮至出穴望者可食) very roughly translates to &ldquo;the looking-at-tide crab lives at the ocean and resembles the <em>benkeigani</em>. It comes out of its hole when the tide arrives and faces the ocean. It is edible.&rdquo;</p><p>This certainly sounds like it could be a fiddler crab, and the references to a white-claw or foot, would likely make it {{lactea}}.</p><p>Many thanks to Dr. Koji Tanno for providing the translations.
science	Catesby1743	Catesby	1743	Cancer arenareus (The Sand Crab)	Catesby_Cancer_arenareus	jpg	n/a	This watercolor is from Catesby (1743). He labeled it <em class="species">Cancer arenareus</em>, the &ldquo;Sand Crab.&rdquo; It is not a fiddler crab, but is rather the closely related ghost crab, <em class="species">Ocypode quadrata.</em> Early taxonomists (<em>e.g.,</em> Linnaeus) tended to place this figure with the fiddler crabs. Even though not a fiddler, I include the image on the site largely because it is such a beautiful early painting.
science	Seba1758	Seba	1758	Cancer uka una	Seba_Uca_una	jpg	tangeri	This drawing is from Seba (1758). He called this <em class="species">Cancer uka una, Brasiliensibus,</em> mistakingly naming it after the wrong image from Marcgrave (1648). Today, this drawing is known to be of {{tangeri}}. This identical image was reprinted in Herbst (1782) as <em class="species">Cancer vocans major,</em> in Shaw &amp; Nodder (1802) as <em class="species">Cancer uka,</em> and in Latreille (1818) as <em class="species">Gelasima Maracoani.</em>
science	Herbst1782	Herbst	1782	Cancer vocans minor	Herbst_Cancer_vocans_minor	jpg	vocans	This drawing is from Herbst (1782). It is labeled <em class="species">Cancer vocans minor,</em> and is likely {{vocans}}. 
science	Herbst1790	Herbst	1790	Cancer tetragonon	Herbst_Cancer_tetragonon	jpg	tetragonon	This drawing is from Herbst (1790). It is the image accompanying the type description of {{tetragonon}}. This species was, unusually for fiddler crabs, described from a female specimen (which at the time they did not realize were different than males, so no association was made between this specimen and the names associated with fiddlers).
science	Latreille1818	Latreille	1818	Gelasima Maracoani	Latreille_Gelasima_Maracoani	png	maracoani	This drawing is from Latreille (1818). It is one of two figures labeled <em class="species">Gelasima Maracoani,</em> but unlike the other figure (which is a reproduction of Seba's (1758) drawing) this does appear to be {{maracoani}}.
science	n/a	Christophe-Paulin de La Poix de Fr&eacute;minville	~1822-1839	Ocypode Uca	deLaPoix_Ocypoda_Uca	jpg	n/a	This watercolor is by Christophe-Paulin de La Poix de Fr&eacute;minville, likely painted between 1822 and 1839 based on animals from the Eastern Atlantic. It was probably meant for a naturalist study never completed. The lower crab is titled &ldquo;l'Uca de Marcgrave&rdquo; with the species name <em class="species">Ocypoda Uca.</em>. Not a fiddler crab, this is clearly a painting of the mangrove crab <em class="species">Ucides cordatus</em> whose name has so often been mixed up with the fiddler crab genus (as described elsewhere on the site).<p>The upper crab is clearly a swimming crab from the family Portunidae; I don't know whether it is simply the Atlantic Blue Crab (<em class="species">Callinectes sapdius</em>) or another species from that family. The given name, which is not a recognized name or synoynm, refers to the four spots on the carapace.</p><p>This image is taken from the website of the Amon Carter Museum of American Art, Fort Worth, Texas, where the original watercolor is currently held in storage.

He labeled it <em class="species">Gelasimus Duperreryi</em>, a species now known as {{tetragonon}}. He later used this same image in another work (1829-1844) but labeled it as yet a different species, <em class="species">Gelasimus chlorophthalmus,</em> (the label of which is incorrect; characteristics of the drawing imply it is is {{tetragonon}}).

It is labeled <em class="species">Gelasimus chlorophthalmus.</em>

science	Owen1839	Owen	1839	Gelasimus minor	Owen_Gelasimus_minor	jpg	perplexa	This drawing is from Owen (1839). He labels it <em class="species">Gelasimus minor.</em> There is a lot of ambiguity about the species represented in this diagram (likely incorrect sampling location, no extent specimen with confusing labeling in records), although a variety of evidence led Crane (1975) to believe it was most likely {{perplexa}}.

He called this species <em class="species">Gelasimus vocans.</em> It is almost certainly {{pugilator}}. A second figure of a "Variety A" is probably {{pugnax}}. Note that the major claw is drawn backwards (i.e., it is a right major claw on a left-handed crab). This figure was probably based on a collected specimen missing the major cheliped and the one they replaced it with for the drawing was a right (and not a left) major cheliped.

stamp	n/a	The Gambia	1984	Postage Stamp	stamp_Gambia	jpg	n/a	This stamp from The Gambia (D2.35) is funny for a few reasons. First, the crab appearing on the stamp does not appear to be a fiddler crab (it could be an over-stylized female, but it looks wrong to me). Second, the species specified on the stamp, <em>Uca pugilator,</em> is found on the eastern shore of North America, nowhere near The Gambia in western Africa. The only species of fiddler crab actually found in The Gambia is {{tangeri}}.
