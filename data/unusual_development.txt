:section:	Males with two large claws (<em>a.k.a.</em>Super-males)	The most commonly observed unusual development is the rare finding of a male with two large claws, rather than the typical one large and one small. The reason this is the most commonly observed is not necessarily that it is the most common in nature, just that it is the easiest to identify as this strange quirk of morphology can readily be seen through binoculars (unlike the others, which all require more direct examination of the reproductive organs). Males with two large claws are presumed to be at a disadvantage with respect to obtaining food, as feeding is generally done with the small claws, but as individuals with this condition are occasionally found in nature, they clearly can find a way to survive. There is some suggestion that this state is seen more commonly in laboratory-reared individuals where there may be reduced selection pressure.</p><figure style="max-width: 600px"><img src="%%MEDIA_PATH%%images/double_clawed.jpg" style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; max-width: 600px" alt="Double-clawed males" title="Double-clawed males" /><figcaption>A pair of double-clawed male fiddler crabs of the species {{rapax}}, raised in an aquarium (Photo from H.-G.

It is not uncommon to find tiny crabs with two larger claws where these later transition to standard asymmetry as the further develop.

Yamaguchi2001.8	arcuata	One found in nature. Additional small juveniles with two large claws were observed, but experimentally this was shown to be a transient state that would not be (normally) maintained through adulthood.

:section:	Males with two small claws	Occasionally when examining large populations of fiddler crabs, male crabs have been found with two small claws largely indistinguishable from those of the females. Males with this condition would be at no survival disadvantage with respect to feeding, but might presumably have difficulty attracting mates. For very small juvenile male fiddler crabs, this is the standard condition before asymmetry develops. Males and females are largely indistinguisable at very small sizes as both asymmetry and other secondary sexual characteristics have not yet developed.				
Morgan1920	pugnax	Six found in nature; in some one of the claws was slightly larger than the other, but overall still much more resembled a female in size and shape				
Morgan1920	pugilator	One found in nature				
Takeda1973	jocelynae	Two found in nature				
Ahmed1976.1	cumulanta	Five young adults found in nature, although see comment below.				
Benetti2003.2	burgersi	Four found in nature				
						
:section:	Females with one large and one small claw	A single instance of an otherwise fully functional female crab (based on exmination and dissection of the ovaries) with a single large claw and a small claw (otherwise identical to those in male fiddlers) has been reported in the literature. As with the previous case, this condition would not be obvious in wild populations as the crab would otherwise superficially appear male in the field.				
Deecaraman1992	pugilator	One found in a shipment from a laboratory supply company				
						
:section:	Intersex crabs	Intersex crabs are those with a seeming mix of male and female features, generally such that the crab is neither clearly male nor female, even upon examination of the reproductive organs. This is a slightly different (although arguably ovelrapping) category than the previous two in which the reproductive organs appeared to be unequivocally male or female, with only the asymmetry of the claws reversed from normal.				
Morgan1920	pugnax	Reports 16 individuals with two small claws, but abdomens in between in size between males and females and often with unclear additional characteristics.				
Morgan1920	pugilator	Reports 8 individuals with two small claws, but abdomens in between in size between males and females and often with unclear additional characteristics.				
Holthuis1959.1	rapax	Crab found in nature with two overly large claws (a bit smaller than those of a standard male), with an abdomen intermediate in size between male and female, and with pleopods similar to females, but with the exopod underdeveloped in the first two.				
Ahmed1976.1	cumulanta	In addition to the males with small claws listed above, he reports a number of what otherwise appeared to be female crabs with intermediate sized abdomens lacking pleopods. This study was focused on very young crabs and may in some cases represent delayed devleopment in juveniles, rather than true intersex crabs.				
Zou2000	pugilator	One found in a shipment from a laboratory supply company. Had reduced bilateral asymmetry in the claws, an abdomen in size between male and female, and a mix of both male and female pleopods on different segments.
