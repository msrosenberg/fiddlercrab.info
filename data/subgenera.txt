subgenus	author	type	Notes	NCBITaxonID	EOLID
Uca	Leach1814	major	This subgenus is equivalent to Crane's <em class="species">Uca.</em> <em class="species">U. tangeri</em> is sometimes placed in this subgenus and sometimes placed in its own monotypic subgenus (below).	53280	.
Afruca	Crane1975	tangeri	This monotypic subgenus consists of the single species <em class="species">U. tangeri.</em> It is sometimes combined into the subgenus <em class="species">Uca.</em> 	.	.
Minuca	Bott1954	mordax	This subgenus is largely equivalent to a combination of Crane's <em class="species">Minuca</em> and <em class="species">Boboruca.</em> I have also included <em class="species">U. pugilator</em> and <em class="species">U. panacea,</em> which Crane placed with the <em class="species">Leptuca.</em>	53288	4316243
Leptuca	Bott1973.2	stenodactylus	This subgenus is largely equivalent to Crane's <em class="species">Celuca,</em> without any of the Indo-West Pacific species. This subgenus is certainly paraphyletic and quite possibly polyphyletic. It is essentially the catch-all group for any broad-fronted American species which is not part of the <em class="species">Minuca.</em>	6771	12020223
Austruca	Bott1973.2	lactea	This subgenus is the <em>U. lactea</em> species complex (formerly part of Crane's <em class="species">Celuca</em>), plus a few recently identified/resurrected species.	1239987	33744938
Paraleptuca	Bott1973.2	chlorophthalmus	This subgenus is roughly equivalent to Crane's <em class="species">Amphiuca</em>, minus <em class="species">U. inversa.</em>	1239991	33744958
Cranuca	Beinlich2006	inversa	This monotypic subgenus consists of the single species <em class="species">U. inversa.</em>	1239992	33744962
Gelasimus	Latreille1817.2	vocans	This subgenus is equivalent to Crane's <em class="species">Thalassuca,</em> minus <em class="species">U. formosensis.</em>	1239990	3119013
Tubuca	Bott1973.2	urvillei	This subgenus is equivalent to Crane's <em class="species">Deltuca.</em>	1239988	33744946
Australuca	Crane1975	bellator	This subgenus is essentially unchanged from Crane's original description, except for the addition of a few species described after the original designation.	53284	12020232
Xeruca	Shih2015.2	formosensis	This monotypic subgenus consists of the single species <em class="species">U. formosensis.</em>	.	.
Petruca	Shih2015.3	panamensis	This monotypic subgenus consists of the single species <em class="species">U. panamensis.</em>	.	.
